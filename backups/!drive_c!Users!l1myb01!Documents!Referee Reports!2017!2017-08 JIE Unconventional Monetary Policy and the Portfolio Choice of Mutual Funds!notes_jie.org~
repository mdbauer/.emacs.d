- confusion about signaling vs. portfolio balance: signaling lowers
  yields domestically and potentially abroad. Three hypotheses, three
  types of effects of portfolio balance channel -- this is all pretty
  confusing, needs clearer conceptualizing. Signaling is an effect of
  portfolio rebalance?! this is wrong. 
- existing literature: inflows/outflows between funds. this paper:
  asset allocation of fund managers. But can they even reallocate,
  given the mandates/investment objectives of mutual funds? the
  premise is that it is (more) interesting to analyze the "portfolio
  rebalancing behavior" of fund managers. the justification, however,
  is not carefully laid out. 
  - yes, the AUM are large, but how much of these funds are ETFs? in those funds there is literally
    zero possibility for portfolio rebalancing. no mention of ETFs at
    all. they remove "passive/index funds" - page 13. how much is left?
  - weak results unsurprising since most asset managers can't rebalance
    much (and ETFs can't at all)
  - trying to learn about portfolio rebalancing by looking at
    portfolios of investors that are severely constrained in their
    ability to rebalance doesn't make much sense
- "most papers ignore the effects of [UMP] operations" is a false
  statement. many papers estimate the effects of LSAP purchases,
  starting with GRRS
- econometric specification:
  - why a common linear time trend? all portfolio weights can't change
    in the same way. 
  - identification? low frequency observations on portfolios and Fed's
    asset purchases are correlated, but this is not causal.
  - wealth effects? if emerging margets are performing well then their
    portfolio weights may grow without rebalancing
  - why include current month's return? this doesn't take care of past
    returns determining the current weights
  - intricate (kitchen sink) econometric specification -- (biased) dynamic panel regression,
    fixed effects, all kinds of controls -- may obfuscate what
    patterns truly are in the data. start simple, show pattern, then
    assess robustness to more sophisticated specification. for
    example, scatter plot of Fed surprise with the change in EM equity
    exposure, to see whether the result in Table 6 (a) is in the data
- UMP (operations) measure is growing over time, trending. will pick
  up whatever happened at the same time as UMP
  - and surprise measure is a high-frequency measure that doesn't make
    much sense to use in a low-frequency analysis

main points:
1. portfolio allocation of funds -- active rebalancing between
   countries typically very restricted. portfolio weights driven by
   past performance, not active decisions? 
2. identification of the  ausal effects of monetary policy on
   decisions of fund managers? highly questionable.
