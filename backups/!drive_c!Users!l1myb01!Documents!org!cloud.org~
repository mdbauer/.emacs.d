* call with Genia Laube and national IT
[2017-09-01 Fri]
my key questions:
- Sandbox
  - licensed software
  - public IP
  - run for days and weeks?
  - Proving Ground vs. Sandbox? future changes?
- other ways to access to AWS?
- other ways to compute in the cloud?
  - Philly? 
  - St. Louis?

Rob Marx on cloud:
- sandbox is an amazon environment that is untrusted
  - made for learning about technologies
  - isolated environment
  - caveat: don't allow any FRB data
  - other Research departments ARE working in Sandbox -- Kansas City
  - no problem to run for days and weeks. usually business rules are
    to stop over night/weekends. but could keep running, can exempt
    that, no problem. 
  - sounds like a great use case
  - licensing: bring your own license
  - don't allow public IP - whitelisted only FRB addresses
  - they are working on an enhancement to bring stuff back - data and
    code
- St. Louis research - a lot of public facing environments 
  - virtual private clouds, amazon, support their private and
    public-facing workloads
  - separate from national IT environment
- Philly Fed - effort on its heels
  - looking into what RAN can do in an Amazon space, HPC part of it
  - talking about it for a while
- other National IT environments
  - Proving Ground - more internal facing, more control, would allow
    FRB data. isolated but could provide FRB services
  - they'll introduce two versions of Proving Ground - public facing
    and internal facing
- collaboration use cases - could support it with external-facing
  Proving Ground

-> Rob Martin (Tri and me) work with Jasmin - 30 minute 

Devin Gordon:
- all of this is a part of the Target State Architecture 
- St. Louis VPC is the first instance 
- Philly -- will serve as research-wide instances within Amazon
  - two different VPC - internal and external 
  - this will be able to serve ANY research department
  - they are just waiting on Philly
- SF NOT a part of the target state architecture
  - if we want to be part of this we need to get involved
- TSA: create shared service opportunities for research
  - could be CADRE or Amazon or anything else
  - most research departments are mostly interested in Amazon
  - Amazon is a strategic partner for the Fed
