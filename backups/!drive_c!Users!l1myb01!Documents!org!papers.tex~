\section{Abstract}
\label{sec:org17d5fae}
A large literature argues that long-term interest rates appear to react far more to high-frequency
(for example, daily or monthly) movements in short-term interest rates than is predicted by the
standard expectations hypothesis. We find that, since 2000, such high-frequency “excess
sensitivity” remains evident in U.S. data and has, if anything, grown stronger. By contrast, the
positive association between low-frequency changes (such as those seen at a six- or twelve-month
horizon) in short- and long-term interest rates, which was quite strong before 2000, has weakened
substantially in recent years. As a result, “conundrums”—defined as six- or twelve-month periods
in which short rates and long rates move in opposite directions—have become far more common
since 2000. We argue that the puzzling combination of high-frequency excess sensitivity and low-
frequency decoupling between short- and long-term rates can be understood using a model in
which (i) shocks to short-term interest rates lead to a rise in term premia on long-term bonds and
(ii) arbitrage capital moves slowly over time. We discuss the implications of our findings for
interest rate predictability, the transmission of monetary policy, and the validity of high-
frequency event study approaches for assessing the impact of monetary
policy.
\section{summary}
\label{sec:orgd40766a}
\begin{itemize}
\item key empirical finding: puzzling excess sensitivity -- high correlation
between daily changes at short and long maturities -- remains after 2000,
but over \textbf{lower frequencies yields have decoupled}. That is,
correlations of 6-month or annual changes between short and long
maturities have substantially declined. Hence, conundrum periods --
movements of short and long yields in opposite directions -- are
more common.
\item excess sensitivity: GSS explained it through EH, proposing as an
explanation changes in pi* (i.e., highly persistent shocks to
interest rates). But (a) it's mostly in real yields and (b)
it's mostly in the term premium (Hanson and Stein, 2015)
\item explanation: annual changes (increases) in level are followed by
flattening of yield curve, much more so than in the past.
\item time series model: include lagged h-period changes in level
\item equilibrium model: shocks to short rates positively correlated with
bond supply, hence short rates and long rates move in the same
direction (mortgage convexity, reaching-for-yield, ALM,
extrapolation, flight-to-quality), but only for a short time because
slow-moving capital eventually adjusts. term premium shocks are
transitory.
\begin{itemize}
\item can match coefficient pattern
\item explanations of change since 2000: higher correlation e.g. because
of more reach-for-yield; more slow-moving capital
\end{itemize}
\item affine DTSM: need to include (unspanned) lags of yield factors
\item implications: event study captures only high frequency effects,
which are transitory; at lower frequencies long rates are much less
affects
\end{itemize}
