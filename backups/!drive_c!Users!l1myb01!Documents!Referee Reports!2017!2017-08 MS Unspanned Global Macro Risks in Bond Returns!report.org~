* Summary

This paper documents that a factor extracted from international
macroeconomic data using Partial Least Squares appears to have both
in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting power for excess returns on
bonds in the US, UK, Japan and Germany. Some evidence suggests that
this global macro factor (GMF) is not spanned by the information in the yield
curves of these countries, i.e., it seems to be an unspanned risk
factor.

* Evaluation

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the ongoing debate about
unspanned macro risks in bond returns. While a number of studies have
documented apparent incremental predictive power of macro risk factors
for bond returns, a lot of these findings are not robust either due to
econometric problems or sub-sample instabilities. The present paper
claims to have found a new factor that is a robust predictor. This
could be an important finding, but as it is, the analysis is not yet
convincing enough. The analysis is somewhat of a hodge-podge of
different results, using various different techniques and regression
specifications. It needs substantial improvement.

First, the focus should be squarely on testing the model with
yield-curve factors and the GMF against the model with only
yield-curve factors, that is, model (9) against model (8) where $x_t$
contains yield-curve factors. The relevant null is $\beta_2=0$, i.e.,
the spanning hypothesis that is at the center of the current debate in
the macro-finance literature. The expectations hypothesis is not the
right benchmark, the literature has long moved on from it because
we've known since Campbell-Shiller and Fama-Bliss that the slope has
predictive power for returns. The paper needs to present convincing
in-sample and out-of-sample evidence that the spanning hypothesis is
robustly violated by the GMF.

In testing the spanning hypothesis, the Cochrane-Piazzesi factor is
clearly the wrong variable to use for $x_t$. It requires estimation of
the factor in a preliminary step, which is undesirable in a recursive,
reproducible out-of-sample forecasting exercise. Importantly, the top
panel of Table 5 shows that the CP factor /worsens/ the forecasting
performance relative to the expectations hypothesis (for three of the
four countries). This is wholly inconsistent with the existing
evidence against the expectations hypothesis and with
Cochrane-Piazzesi's results. It's unclear what is going on/wrong here,
but what is clear is that the null model needs to include yield curve
factors, and the conventional wisdom suggests that these improve
predictions relative to the expectations hypothesis.

More generally, the authors need to connect with the existing
literature, and where the results differ from existing results, the
paper needs to give a clear explanation for such differences. The
above-mentioned issue with the (local) CP factor was one example of an
inconsistency with the literature. Another important one is that
Ludvigson-Ng find strong predictive power of local macro factors for
bond returns (although the robustness of this finding across sample
periods has since been questioned). Why does the present paper come to
the opposite conclusion that local macro factors do not help predict
bond returns? There are a number of possible explanations for the
differences---sample period, macro data, bond returns, regression
specification, how the factors are constructed, the econometric method---and each one needs to be investigated with a magnifying
glass. For example, if the authors use the exact same data as
Ludvigson-Ng but their own PLS methodology, do they still find the
same result? Another inconsistency is with Dahlquist-Hasseltoft, as
mentioned on page 17. For any such difference with the existing
literature, the reader will need to be convinced that she should
believe this paper and not the previously published result.
