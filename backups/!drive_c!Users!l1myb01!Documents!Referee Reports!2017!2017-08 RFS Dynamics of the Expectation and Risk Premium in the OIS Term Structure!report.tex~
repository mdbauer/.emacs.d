\section{Summary}
\label{sec:org4d21581}

This paper estimates six different dynamics term structure models (DTSMs) to OIS
rates from 2002 to 2015, including a proposed new "stepwise CIR"
model. Two models, this
new model as well as a jump-Gaussian model, explicitly incorporate the
meeting schedule of the FOMC. The models are estimated using Bayesian methods. For
decompositions of movements in the OIS term spread, the models that
incorporate the FOMC meeting schedule imply that the expectations
component accounts for most of these movements, whereas the other four
models ascribe an important role to the risk premium component. The
authors argue that this supports the use of these two models, as other
evidence and market practice suggests that OIS rates mainly reflect
expectations and not risk premia. The paper also attempts to interpret
the results of the stepwise CIR model in terms of whether the Fed was
"behind the curve" at certain times. 

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:orgafbc58c}

The paper is a nice exercise in modeling OIS rates, but it adds no new
insights to our understanding of OIS markets, the effects of monetary
policy, or the behavior of expectations and risk premiums. The authors
mainly use the models to confirm their prior that expectations are the
main drivers of OIS rates. In light of a host of other published
evidence, some of it cited in the paper, this may be a reasonable
prior, but on the other hand Piazzesi and Swanson (2008, JME) argue
that risk premia may be important even at these short maturities. The
paper does not add new evidence to this debate. It is also well-known
that accounting for FOMC meeting schedules can be important when
modeling short-term interest rates, as evidenced in the work by
Piazzesi and others. 

The paper claims to generate new insights about whether the Fed was
behind or ahead of the curve. This is based on the notion that when
market expectations deviate from the current federal funds rate, then
the Fed was "behind the curve", such as in 2006 (when the market
expected easing) or in 2015 (when the market expected
tightening). This is very different from what is commonly meant by the
expression that a central bank falls "behind the curve": this means
that it reacts too slowly and too late to economic
developments. Furthermore, modern central banking involves managing
expectations of future policy rates, as documented by a large
literature (see, for example, the target and path factors of
Guerkaynack, Sack and Swanson, 2005, IJCB). So of course there are
episodes where expectations deviate from the current policy rate, but
this does in no way mean that the Fed fell behind the curve. The
paper's interpretation of the DTSM estimates regarding the Fed's
policy stance is plain wrong.

A key result of the paper is that the stepwise CIR model attributes
changes in the OIS term spread to expectations. But this is almost
surely a mechanical result of the model's structure. The main level
factor is the (highly unusual) "reversion center", but this is
deterministic. The fact that investors ignore the uncertainty in this
factor makes this a highly unrealistic bond pricing model. The result
is that there is no risk premium associated with it. Since the key
yield curve factor has no risk premium it is naturally impossible for
the risk premium to play a big role in this model. Another problem
with this model is that there is an enormous
amount of parameters to estimate, and still the model fits the cross
section of yields much worse than a simple two-factor CIR model. 

Why do we need the stepwise CIR model? It has the abovementioned
problems, and in addition the much more reasonable
jump-Gaussian model tells exactly the same story about expectations
vs.\textasciitilde{}risk premia. I see many problems but no benefits to the stepwise
CIR model.

What is puzzling and worth investigating is why the jump-Gaussian
model gives such different results from the standard affine Gaussian
and CIR models. The authors do not provide enough details on these
models as they focus the exposition on the stepwise CIR model. They
should instead describe exactly what these models are that they
estimate. Where do they fall within the Dai-Singleton (2000, JF) model
classification? What is the speed of mean reversion under the
P/real-world measure and the Q/risk-neutral measure? I am guessing
that the estimation on daily data leads to fast mean reversion, which
makes the expectation component in the Gaussian model essentially
flat. This is what I recommend the authors investigate more and to
provide more details on. It is important to compare apples to apples,
and to explain exactly what exactly cause the dramatic
differences for the role of the expectations vs. risk premium
components. Is it really the incorporation of the FOMC meeting
schedule or, as it appears to me, some other model feature?
