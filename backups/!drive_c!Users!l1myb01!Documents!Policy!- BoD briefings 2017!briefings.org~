- Summary: economy overall is at "equilibrium" meaning it's close to
  its long-run trend path
  - economy has "fully recovered" (JW)
  - I will drill down on the topic of long-run trends, how they
    feature in our forecast, how we use them to separate the signal
    from the noise
- GDP: output continues to grow at a healthy pace
  - low Q1 number was an outlier due to transitory/one-off factors
  - Q1 was, as we expected, revised up from 0.5 to 1.2% (at annual
    pace). Improved from initial estimate but still a low number.
  - Q1 low because: Seasonality (seasonal downward bias), weather, low inventory
    investment.
    - path act: delayed reimbursement of taxes for low-income
      households
  - expect bounceback in Q2, growth around 3%, mainly due to
    - consumer spending
    - inventory investment
  - recent data on spending and production suggests continued strong
    momentum, strong fundamentals in Q2
    - hard data: retail sales strong; industrial production 1%, strong
      (manufacturing improved over last few months); capacity
      utilization rose in April (although slightly below long-run
      average, indicates some slack); CAPEX indicators solid; CFNAI up
      to positive, reflecting mostly production-related
      indicators. suggests that growth in economic activity is
      somewhat above its trend
    - soft data: conference board consumer confidence declined
      slightly but still highest since Dec. 2003; ISM index consistent
      with expansion
  - consumer spending bolstered by
    - ongoing job gains
    - rising household incomes and wealth -- strong equity market
    - buoyant consumer sentiment - remains high both within this cycle
      and in broader historical context
  - overall expect 2017 GDP growth near 2 percent
  - compares to g* of 1.6%
  - suggests economy is growing somewhat faster than trend
\newpage
- labor market continues to improve
  - payroll growth continues at robust if somewhat slower pace
    - confirmed that low March was a hiccup
    - May below expectations and April revised down
    - but both still substantially above the "breakeven rate" that is
      needed to keep unmployment stable (80-100k), as is the 6-month
      average
  - indications that pace has slowed because it's harder to fill vacancies
    - 6 million job openings in April, record high
  - UR fell 0.4pp in last three months!
    - now lowest since May 2001
    - UR four tenths below the FOMC's median estimate of u*. Most
      participants are between 4.75 and 5%
    - and even further below our u* estimate of 4.9%
  - same story from various labor market indicators
    - consumer sentiment about labor market conditions
    - participation rate is low but that's because of structural
      reasons -- demographics, disability insurance, skills mismatch,
      lack of mobility. Participation has remained stable for quite a
      while and is close to its trend level. Don't
      expect significant increase in participation
    - measures of underutilization close to pre-recession lows
    - involuntary part time (and U6) slightly elevated but that's
      because employers now rely more on part time (structural change)
  - wage growth heating up as slack declines (source GS 5/16)
    - wage growth had been missing from this recovery
    - but now wage acceleration is underway
    - compensation per hour; average hourly earnings 2.5%, which isn't
      particularly fast but better than what we have seen over most of
      this recovery; not as fast as before the crisis because of slow
      productivity growth
    - various wage trackers (Atlanta Fed, GS) show faster speed
    - expect wage growth to further accelerate
  - in sum, the data is consistent with ongoing tightening and a labor
    market that is at or beyond full employment
\newpage
- inflation
  - in February PCE inflation briefly surpassed the FOMC's 2% target
  - but recently some downside surprises -- inflation remains somewhat
    stubborn -- slowdown in core inflation
  - year-over-year core CPI 1.9% in April, down .3 from Feb, below exp.
  - core PCE was 0.2% in April, which was a solid print, but
    year-over-year is only 1.5% -- we think this is a low point
  - in our view this slight weakness mainly due to transitory/one-off factors
    - several idiosyncratic factors
    - *half* of deceleration due to quality adjustment of cell phone
      prices (Verizon plans unlimited data--quality adjusted this is a
      price drop)
    - import inflation was weak in March and April due to dollar
      appreciation -- external deflationary pressures
  - underlying trend is still healthy. at the heart of our forecast is
    the view that *declining slack and accelarating wage growth* will
    support prices, and that inflation will resume its gradual rise
  - in sum, we view the slowdown in core inflation as primarily a
    transitory phenomenon
  - our medium-term outlook remains unchanged
  - but there is a fair amount of uncertainty surrounding this
    baseline forecast, and we will be watching closely whether
    slowdown continues
- financial conditions generally eased of the last six months and remain strongly
    supportive of consumer spending and output
  - higher equity prices, driven by perceptions of an improved global
    outlook and positive news on corporate earnings
  - lower yields, partly in reaction to inflation data and political headlines
  - lower credit spreads
  - equity market volatility very low, both actual volatility and
    option-implied volatility ("fear index" VIX near multidecade lows)
  - rising commodity prices
  - U.S. political uncertainty weighed briefly on market sentiment and
    stock prices, but markets soon recovered
  - segue: what matters more than ups and downs in financial markets
    is the overall trend. the same holds for most aspects of our
    forecast: what matters is the trend
\newpage
- the role of trends in forecasting
  - Macroeconomic and financial data noisy
    - Single data releases affect forecast little
    - Ups and downs in financial markets less important than underlying trend
    - how do we separate the signal from the noise?
    - what is the framework in the back of our heads?
  - when we forecast economic variables there are *three questions* we
    continually think about: (1) Where are we now? (2) Where are we
    going? (3) How are we going to get there?
    - We take *signal* about these three things
  - "Nowcast" - gauge where we are now (word creation, forecast of the
    present)
    - examples of things we nowcast
    - various indicators affect our nowcast of Q2 GDP
  - Long-run trends -- after transitory factors and "shocks" have died
    out -- equilibrium. g*, u*, pi*, i*
  - gaps: How large is the gap and how quickly can we close it?
- the trend in interest rates
  - Mary Daly talked about this in April
    - "equilibrium FFR" = 2% + 1% = 3% (median SEP long-run
      projection)
    - we can call this "normal interest rate" i*
    - this corresponds to the "normal/long-run fed funds rate"
    - and it also drives all other interest rates, including Treasury
      yields, corporate bond yields, mortgage rates
  - pi* inflation trend/perceived inflation target
    - this was the main issue of monetary policy in 1970s and 1980s
  - r* equilibrium real rate
    - this has shifted into focus since pi* has stabilized
    - remember: r* is the real (inflation-adjusted) interest rate
        consistent with the economy growing at potential and inflation at
        target. r=r* means monetary policy is neutral, neither
        expansionary nor contractionary
    - FOMC "central tendency" is 0.8-1.0%
    - large degree of uncertainty around estimates of r*, but some
      consensus that it has fallen quite a bit over the last 20 years
- Decline in pi* and r*.
  - this pi* estimate is from long-range surveys (SPF)
  - r* estimate is the average from three macroeconomic models,
    including Laubach-Williams
    - models agree that r* has fallen and is currently quite close to zero
    - somewhat lower r* than from surveys/SEP, which are closer to 1%
  - sum of the two gives an estimate of the "normal interest rate"
  - don't put too much stock in the /exact level/ of the last data
    point, due to the uncertainty around estimates of r*
- long-term rate fluctuates around trend
  - slightly above but generally close to this estimate of i*
    - higher because on average long-term rates are above short-term
      rates, the yield curve on average slopes upward
  - What does this mean in practice?
    - When we ask the question "Where is the ten-year yield going to
      be a few years from now?" we would give a very different answer
      in 2017 than in, say, the 1990s. There is clearly a "new normal"
    - We can't just assume we are going back to the average post-war
      interest rate.
    - Instead, we have to account for these shifting trends.
    - In my research I have found that doing so makes a big difference
      for forecasting and understanding the evolution of interest
      rates.
    - We need to account for trend components in interest rates,
      just like we do in macroeconomic indicators like GDP growth and inflation
  - Consequences of low normal interest rate:
    - greater chance of returning to zero lower bound with the need to
      use unconventional monetary policy tools
    - could avoid this by rising pi* (higher inflation target) or r*
      (improved long-run economic growth)
    - in any event, lower r* and i* poses new challenges for monetary policy
- tie in with economic outlook, circle back to overall situation

other topics:
- risks to the forecast
  - downside and upside risks are balanced
  - downside risk: low inflation. the slowdown in core inflation could
    be more persistent than we anticipate
  - upside risk: labor market overheating, increasing wage pressure
- balance sheet
  - auto-pilot, boring, "gradual and predictable reduction"
  - want to avoid situation where balance sheet is automatically reduced
    more quickly when economy slows down (rates fall, refis and MBS
    prepayments speed up)
  - hence the proposal is to use "roll-off caps" which limit the amounts
    that are allowed to mature, amounts above the limits are reinvested
  - roll-off caps gradually increased
