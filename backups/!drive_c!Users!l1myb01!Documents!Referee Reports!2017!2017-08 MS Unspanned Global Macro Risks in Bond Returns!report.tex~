\section{Summary}
\label{sec:org2664c9c}

This paper documents that a factor extracted from international
macroeconomic data using Partial Least Squares appears to have both
in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting power for excess returns on
bonds in the US, UK, Japan and Germany. Some evidence suggests that
this global macro factor (GMF) is not spanned by the information in the yield
curves of these countries, i.e., it seems to be an unspanned risk
factor.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:org4160062}

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the ongoing debate about
unspanned macro risks in bond returns. While a number of studies have
documented apparent incremental predictive power of macro risk factors
for bond returns, a lot of these findings are not robust either due to
econometric problems or sub-sample instabilities. The present paper
claims to have found a new factor that is a robust predictor. This
could be an important finding, but as it is, the analysis is not yet
convincing enough. The analysis is somewhat of a hodge-podge of
different results, using various different techniques and regression
specifications. It needs substantial improvement.

\begin{enumerate}
\item First, the focus should be squarely on testing the model with
yield-curve factors and the GMF against the model with only
yield-curve factors, that is, the alternative model (9) against
the null model (8) where
\(x_t\) contains yield-curve factors. (See also model (18) which
seems to me the right proposed alternative model.) The relevant
null is \(\beta_2=0\), i.e., the spanning hypothesis that is at the
center of the current debate in the macro-finance literature. The
expectations hypothesis is not the right benchmark, the literature
has long moved on from it because we've known since
Campbell-Shiller and Fama-Bliss that the slope has predictive power
for returns. The paper needs to present convincing in-sample and
out-of-sample evidence that the spanning hypothesis is robustly
violated by the GMF.

\item In testing the spanning hypothesis, the Cochrane-Piazzesi factor
is clearly the wrong variable to use for \(x_t\). It requires
estimation of the factor in a preliminary step, which is
undesirable in a recursive, reproducible out-of-sample forecasting
exercise. Importantly, the top panel of Table 5 shows that the CP
factor \emph{worsens} the forecasting performance relative to the
expectations hypothesis (for three of the four countries). This is
wholly inconsistent with the existing evidence against the
expectations hypothesis and with Cochrane-Piazzesi's results. It's
unclear what is going on/wrong here, but what is clear is that the
null model needs to include yield curve factors, and the
conventional wisdom suggests that these should improve predictions
relative to the expectations hypothesis.

\item More generally, the authors need to connect with the existing
literature, and where the results differ from existing results, the
paper needs to give a clear explanation for such differences. The
above-mentioned issue with the (local) CP factor was one example of
an inconsistency with the literature. Another important one is that
Ludvigson-Ng find strong predictive power of local macro factors
for bond returns (although the robustness of this finding across
sample periods has since been questioned). Why does the present
paper come to the opposite conclusion that local macro factors do
not help predict bond returns? There are a number of possible
explanations for the differences---sample period, macro data, bond
returns, regression specification, how the factors are constructed,
the econometric method---and each one needs to be investigated with
a magnifying glass. For example, if the authors use the exact same
data as Ludvigson-Ng but their own PLS methodology, do they still
find the same result? Another inconsistency is with
Dahlquist-Hasseltoft, as mentioned on page 17. For any such
difference with the existing literature, the reader will need to be
convinced that she should believe this paper and not the previously
published result.

\item A crucial problem with pseudo-out-of-sample analysis as in the
present paper is that the sample split can be chosen by the authors
with the benefit of hindsight. Hence it is important to report
results for different, or ideally for all possible sample
splits. Welch-Goyal do this very well: they plot the cumulative
difference in the sum of squared errors against the split of the
sample, which allows the reader to verify how robust the
outperformance of a given model is. By contrast, in the present
paper the OOS results are for one specific sample periodfrom
1995:Q1 to 2015:Q4. The authors need to report results for a
variety of sample splits, ideally as done by Welch-Goyal.

\item Another concern about the OOS analysis is the very
small OOS period of 21 years, which includes only 21
non-overlapping annual returns. Any test for equal forecast
accuracy will likely suffer from substantial small-sample
results. The authors need to be more careful about this inference,
and should probably report results for alternative
tests. Diebold-Mariano is a simple way to do this inference, and small-sample
corrections are available. Giacomini-White have argued that the
Diebold-Mariano test is more broadly applicable than previously
thought. The authors of the present paper report the (uncommon) out-of-sample
\(R^2\) with the (somewhat uncommon) Clark-West "MSPE-adjusted
statistic." They should report the results in a more standard
format. And of course my comment from above is worth reiterating:
the right comparison is between the model with yield factors and
the model with both yield factors and the GMF (or LMF).

\item There is another econometric problem: the inference appears to
ignore the estimation uncertainty underlying the PLS factor. The
authors mention a wild bootstrap, but they are using it to test the
wrong (expectations) hypothesis and don't show how it can be
applied to tests of the spanning hypothesis. The authors use the
Bauer-Hamilton bootstrap, which apparently works well for testing
the spanning hypothesis, but they do not address the issue that the
GMF predictor is estimated using PLS. They need to carefully
address this issue. They may have to use a bootstrap procedure to
account for the PLS estimation uncertainty in the in-sample
tests. In any event, they need to refer to other studies that have
applied the PLS method, and explain whether they assess forecast
accuracy differently than in existing studies, and if so, why.

\item Finally, the paper lacks a thorough  discussion of the underlying
economics, the broader relevance, and more generally of the
interpretation of the results. This holds for the introduction as
well as for the paper more generally (e.g., in section 3.2 the
only interpretation is a throwaway sentence on "the integrated nature of
international bond markets"). The key questions that need to be
addressed are: Why should we care? What is the relevance of
unspanned macro risk factors? How do the results change our
understanding of bond risks and the term structure of interest
rates? How do the results fit into the literatures on the spanning
hypothesis; on international
bond comovements; on the econometrics of predicting financial
returns? General statements such as "global macro factors represent
a different source of risks other than interest rate risks" do not
sufficiently clarify to the reader why this paper is
important. Furthermore, what would really add value is to try to
understand what exactly it is about the GMF that helps predict
returns, e.g., certain macro variables or patterns that are
reflected in the GMF. It would be well worth it to drill down
further into the sources of predictability.
\end{enumerate}

Other issues:
\begin{itemize}
\item The correlations reported in Table 1 are not at all "indicative that
some global common factors may predict international excess bond
returns" (p. 13) because they simply reflect cross-sectional contemporaneous
correlations.
\item The statement "We find that annual excess bond returns of different
maturities in each market are highly correlated." (p. 13) is not
supported by any numbers in the tables.
\item The authors report first-order autocorrelations of \emph{annual}
overlapping returns. These are serially correlated by
construction, so it is meaningless to calculate and interpret these
autocorrelations.
\item It is not clear for what return Figure 2 reports cumulative SSEs.
\item The authors make a pretty big deal of calculating the "economic
value" of adding the predictors (again, mistakenly, relative to the
expectations hypothesis). But the numbers at the bottom of page 15
seem very small, so doesn't this say that there is little economic
value? Also, how can the OOS \(R^2\) change so much and the economic
value change by so little? This appears inconsistent. All this needs to
be clarified or, better, deleted in order to have more space
for careful econometrics.
\item In Figure 3 there is no return visible, so no correlation can be
seen. Also, the authors should report the correlation, and they need
to compare the cyclicality measured this way between the null model
and the proposed model.
\end{itemize}
