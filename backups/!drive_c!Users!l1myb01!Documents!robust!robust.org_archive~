remind people in 3.1, 4.1 about what the bootstrap does and why it's good
- how does it deal with delta?
- report summaries -- delta, rho, gamma
- bridge the gap with theory
- provide intuition for delta (for PC1)

Yes we definitely need to cite that paper. Sorry I forgot about
that. An important point is the following (which Caroline Pflueger
reminded me of): In dividend-yield predictions of stock returns,
Stambaugh bias inflates the R^2 and coefficients, and so makes the
predictability spuriously stronger. But in regressions of bond returns
on the yield curve, it works the other way, as shown by Bekaert et
al--the small-sample issues make the predictability weaker, i.e.,
accounting for it makes the rejections of the EH stronger. I
personally don't have great intuition for this (yet) but that's the
common view. I think this is what Cochrane had in mind when he was
talking about the sign of delta and that it matters -- it does matter
for the evidence on PC1-PC3. This probably implies that in our
predictive regressions for bond returns the true p-values on PC1-PC3
are smaller than the ones we report, which would support our
conclusions that level and slope are robust predictors. Here are some
places where we could cite this paper: (a) in the introduction, (b) in
2.3, (c) in 3.1 when we discuss the sign of delta and/or when we
discuss the significance of PC1-PC3.

- we want loadings to be orthonormal so that we have factor structure
- but we also want intuitively understandable loadings
  -> can we have both?
YES: simply make sure W[J,] is positive for each yield PC

 -  avoid estimating delta and using normal random variable?
For the bootstrap used in our Monte Carlo simulation, I realized that
we need to estimate delta--it wouldn't be fair to just use the true
delta--so I did. It works pretty well. It would be even cleaner if we
just resampled regression residuals, jointly with the AR(1)
innovations, instead of estimating delta and drawing from a normal
distribution.

** DONE mention in 2.2.2 what we're going to do about delta
** DONE spanning / factor structure
  - more robust way to say it -- tone down language
** DONE sub-sample stability / how Cochrane thinks of their results
  - stability of the CP factor across samples
  - we don't attack their whole paper, but only the 4th PC
  - acknowledge what they do
  - be precise about what they do and what we do
  => try to come up with some numbers to support our handwaving
  - we want to acknowledge that they did some tests for subsample stability
  - but the stability they document is the predictive power of the CP factor
  - we agree that level/slope/curve are stable in their predictive power
  - and CP factor is mostly (76%) driven by those, so that's not inconsistent
  - so our results and theirs are in fact consistent
*** what they did
We did extensive subsample analysis, p. 10 here
http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/john.cochrane/research/papers/cochrane_piazzesi_appendix.pdf
at least we recognize the importance of subsample stability, and
it¹s-not-one-data-point stability, and documented it.

Figure 6 and 7 of our paper
http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/john.cochrane/research/papers/cochrane_piazzesi_bond_risk_premia.pdf
Show exactly that you can see the feature in the data that the
regressions are using, and that it is important across most of the
important data points of high and low returns. At least reference the
figures if you want to say you can¹t see it, but like subsample
stability, a pattern visible in many recessions (not influential data
points), visibility to the eye, and the connection to business cycles
(correlation of CP with unemployment) was at least a very important
part of our battery of is-it-real tests.

P. 29. Out of sample stability. We¹ve looked a lot at this. The main
failure of our regression out of sample comes from the nutty behavior
of the right hand variable in the 2008 financial crisis. The coupon
bond effect in that December 2008 sends the FB forward curve nuts, and
it predicts big things that of course did not happen. After that, it¹s
not bad.

The most recent graphs along with color versions of most of these
reliability tests are here FYI starting on p. 567

*** what we should do

** DONE Markov property
  - Jim sees it as an inconsistency
  - tone down the language

** DONE tables should be self-explanatory
  - add some more notes to the table
** DONE delta and gamma in practice
  - check what we get for negative delta in simulations
  - delta -> three correlations, or one number sqrt(R^2)
  - gamma -> 3x2 matrix, or two R^2 (INF on PCs and GRO on PCs)
=> calculate numbers and show them to jim
