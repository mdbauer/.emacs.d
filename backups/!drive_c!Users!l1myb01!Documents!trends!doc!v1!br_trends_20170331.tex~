  Structural changes in the economy are key determinants

  demonstrates the tight empirical linkages between these macro trends
  and long-term Treasury yields, confirming the predictions of
  no-arbitrage theories of the yield curve: $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$ capture
  the persistent movements in long-term interest rates, substantially improve
  long-range interest rate forecasts, predict excess bond returns, and
  account for a substantial share of interest rate risk at low
  frequencies.  Therefore, modeling of the yield curve or analysis of

\section{Introduction}

The level of the risk-free real rate of return that would prevail in the absence of transitory disturbances has long been of interest to researchers, macroeconomic policymakers, and financial investors \citep{clarida-new-neutral,yellen-pace}. However, recent structural changes in the global economy have made measurement of this equilibrium real rate even more important. Various factors, such as slower productivity growth and an aging population, appear to have pushed down the equilibrium real rate through their effect on global saving and investment. Accordingly, over the past decade, much new research has estimated the level and time variation in the equilibrium real short-term interest rate, which is usually denoted as $r^\ast$.\footnote{\label{fn:rstar} Discussions of the decline in $r^\ast$ include \cite{hhhw}, \cite{rachel-smith}, \cite{laubach-williams},  \cite{johannsen-mertens}, \cite{kiley}, and \cite{lubik-mathes} among many others.}  So far though, there has been essentially no work on how changes in $r^\ast$ will effect the dynamics of the term structure of interest rates. In this paper, we provide a first analysis of how changes in the equilibrium real rate will alter yield curves and bond risk pricing.

A simple illustration of the potential importance of accounting for the equilibrium real rate is provided in Figure \ref{fig:data1}. The secular decline in the 10-year Treasury rate since the early 1980s exemplifies the gradual fall in the general level of U.S. interest rates. A key driver early on in this decline was a reduction in the long-run expected level of inflation, which is often referred to as trend inflation and denoted as $\pi^\ast$. Figure \ref{fig:data1} displays a measure of trend inflation based largely on long-horizon inflation projections from a survey of
professional forecasters (details of this measure are described in the data section below). While the link between trend inflation and interest rates is widely recognized, e.g., \cite{cieslak-povala}, it obviously does not account for all of the decline in yields. For the past two decades, $\pi^\ast$ has stabilized around 2 percent while longer-term interest rates have continued to drift lower. Instead, much of the recent downtrend in yields appears to reflect a lower equilibrium real short-term interest rate, as is evident in the simple composite measure of $r^\ast$ shown in Figure \ref{fig:data1} (details of this measure are also described below). According to this measure, the equilibrium real short rate remained little changed in a range
between 2 and 3 percent from 1970 to around 2000 when it started to gradually fall to below 1 percent currently. We argue that accounting for this recent downtrend in $r^\ast$ as well as the earlier downward trend in $\pi^\ast$---an environment of falling stars---is critical for understanding the dynamics of interest rates and for assessing bond risk and expected returns.

Of course, nominal interest rates reflect expectations of future inflation and real short rates---including their trend components---subject to a risk adjustment. We illustrate this connection in an affine no-arbitrage term structure model that allows for stochastic trends in inflation and the real short rate---$\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$.\footnote{For convenience, our model assumes that these macroeconomic trends follow random walks, but the same arguments generalize to the case when they are highly persistent stationary variables.} The model shows that $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$ act as level factors for the nominal yield curve, as suggested by Figure \ref{fig:data1}. In addition, the model describes how the cyclical components of inflation and the real rate affect short rates more than long rates and how a risk-premium factor affects long rates more than short rates. All of these theoretical model propositions lead to testable implications about the importance of both $r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$ for interest rates. We take these propositions to the data and examine empirical four different implications. Essentially, we provide four tests of whether trends in both inflation and real rates are quantitatively important for interest rates.

First, we document that time variation in both $\pi^\ast_t$ and
$r^\ast_t$ is responsible for most of the persistence in yields. While
interest rates themselves are extremely persistent, the difference
between long-term interest rates and $i^\ast_t = \pi^\ast_t + r^\ast_t$
exhibits quick mean reversion. Furthermore, regressions
of long-term yields on the macroeconomic trends recover the unit
coefficients predicted by our model. Our findings expand importantly on
the results of \cite{cieslak-povala}, henceforth CP,
who regress nominal yields on their proxy for trend inflation. While
we confirm their finding that $\pi^\ast_t$ is an important persistent
component of interest rates, we show that it is also crucial to
include $r^\ast_t$ in order to fully capture the
trend component. Indeed, the importance of time variation
in $r^\ast_t$ explains why past research has generally been unable to
find a stable cointegrating relation between nominal interest rates
and inflation, going back to \cite{rose} and recently summarized by
\cite{neely-rapach}.

Second, we show that accounting for the macroeconomic trends leads to substantial
improvements in interest rate forecast accuracy relative to the usual no-change/random
walk benchmark at medium and long forecast horizons. Furthermore,
Focusing only on $\pi^\ast_t$ as the trend is insufficient. To achieve better
forecasts, it is crucial to incorporate $r^\ast_t$ in the shifting
endpoint of nominal interest rates. We document improvements in
forecast accuracy over the random walk and ``$\pi^\ast_t$-only''
alternatives that are both economically and statistically
significant. Furthermore, our no-arbitrage model
shows that these recently documented forecast improvements are a
natural consequence of the time series properties of inflation and the
real short rate.

Third, accounting for a time-varying $r^\ast_t$ is important
for understanding return predictability and estimating bond risk
premia. Recently, CP employed the connection between trend inflation
and interest rates to decompose the nominal yield curve into risk
premiums and the expectations hypothesis (EH) component (i.e., a term
that equals the average short-term interest rate that investors expect
to prevail during the life of a bond). They present strong evidence
for predictive power of the inflation trend for excess bond returns,
which suggests that incorporating the inflation trend is important to
understand the risk premium/EH decomposition. Since $r^\ast_t$ plays
the same role of a persistent level factor for nominal interest rates
as does $\pi^\ast_t$, our model predicts that if $\pi^\ast_t$ has
predictive power for bond returns so should $r^\ast_t$. Hence we
expand the analysis of CP by introducing shifts in the equilibrium
real interest rate into the analysis of risk premiums, and we indeed
find that $r^\ast$
has strong incremental predictive power for bond returns. This
indicates that measures of the bond risk premium based on a shifting
$\pi^\ast$, such as the cycle factor proposed by CP, as well as
empirical decompositions of long-term interest rates into expectations
and term premium components, should be enlarged to include a
shifting $r^\ast$ as well.

Fourth, we estimate directly how important the trend components of
inflation and real rates are for the variance of interest rate changes
at different frequencies. In other words, we answer the question how
much interest rate risk is due to these macroeconomic
trends. \cite{duffee-inflation-risk} proposes to use the ratio of the
variance of inflation news to the variance of innovations in nominal
interest rates as a measure of inflation risk. He documents that for
one-quarter innovations, this ratio is small for U.S.~Treasury yields,
using survey data to measure inflation surprises. We extend this measure to
consider variance ratios not only for one-period (quarterly)
innovations but for $h$-period innovations, since the contributions to
interest rate risk may be different at lower frequencies. This allows
us to measure, for example, the contribution of unexpected changes in
inflation over, say, the next five or ten years to the risk in nominal
bonds. We estimate ratios of variances of changes instead of variances
of innovations, which is much simpler as it does not require a model
for expectations---all that is needed are our empirical proxies of the trend
components. Empirically, we provide novel estimates of the interest
rate risk, across horizons, that is due to changes in the inflation
trend, the real-rate trend, and the overall trend. For quarterly
changes, we find the same low contribution of inflation risk, around 10\%, that was
reported by Duffee. But in line with our theoretical predictions, the
variance ratios increase quickly and substantially with the horizon,
to a ratio of 30\%-40\% for ten-year changes. Although confidence
intervals are necessarily wide, our estimates suggest that over post-war
U.S.~history, a large share of the risk for investors with long
holding periods was due to changes in the macroeconomic trend components of nominal
yields.

Overall, our paper provides strong empirical evidence of the
importance of the macroeconomic trends for the nominal yield
curve in general and for $r^\ast_t$ in particular. This has
far-reaching implications for macro-finance modeling
of interest rates and bond risk premia. Both structural and
reduced-form models of the yield curve need to allow for slow-moving
macroeconomic trend components in order to accurately capture interest
rate dynamics. Variations in both the inflation trend and the
equilibrium real interest rate are quantitatively important. While the
former has been increasingly recognized, a
time-varying $r^\ast_t$ has been essentially ignored in yield curve analysis,
which we argue is a substantial and ill-advised oversight. Our
results are important for empirical work on the term premium in
long-term interest rates, for practitioners forecasting bond yields
and returns, and more generally for researchers trying to understand
the drivers and historical evolution of the term structure of interest rates.

Our paper relates to several strands of literature. A large literature
documents the importance of a trend component in the inflation
rate. Prominent examples are \cite{kozicki-tinsley} and
\cite{stock-watson-ucsv}; for a survey on inflation forecasting that
shows the importance of trends see \cite{faust-wright};
\cite{clark-doh} compare models of trend inflation. The persistence in
the real interest is the topic of a large literature that originated
with \cite{rose} and was surveyed by
\cite{neely-rapach}, and a related strand of literature investigates
the long-run Fisher effect, as in
\cite{mishkin92}. A more recent literature, originated by
\cite{laubach-williams}, uses macroeconomic and statistical models to
estimate the equilibrium real interest rate and to understand its
structural drivers (see the references in footnote
\ref{fn:rstar}). Our paper sheds a new light on these related strands
of literature by showing that the apparent trends in inflation and real
interest rates are not only consistent with the observed behavior of
the yield curve, but are in fact crucially important to understand this
behavior. Our results imply that there is no long-run Fisher
effect. Finally, within the macro-finance literature on the
term structure of interest rates, some models have been proposed that
allow for changes in trend inflation; see \cite{rudebuschwu},
\cite{bcm}, and \cite{htv}. However these models generally assume a
constant equilibrium real rate. Finally, our long-horizon forecast
results are consistent with previous evidence, in
particular \cite{dijk-etal}, showing that it is important to allow for
time-varying endpoints when forecasting interest rates, but our
approach using the endpoint $i^\ast_t = \pi^\ast_t + r^\ast_t$
is both simpler and more accurate.

The paper is structured as follows: Section \ref{sec:model} introduces
a simple no-arbitrage model of the yield curve that allows for trend
components in inflation and the real rates, and derives testable
implications. Section \ref{sec:data} presents our empirical proxies
for $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$. In Section \ref{sec:cointegration} we
investigate the persistence of interest rates and the evidence for
cointegration. In Section \ref{sec:forecasting} we show the
improvements in forecast accuracy that are possible when accounting
for macroeconomic trends in interest rates. Section \ref{sec:returns}
documents the evidence for the incremental predictive power of
$\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$ for future excess bond returns. Section
\ref{sec:horizons} presents new estimates, using variance ratios, for
the role of inflation risk and macroeconomic trends at different
frequencies. Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes.

\section{A no-arbitrage model with macro trends}
\label{sec:model}

Our theoretical framework is an affine term structure model for real and nominal
yields that demonstrates how, under absence of arbitrage, changes in $\pi_t^\ast$ and
$r_t^\ast$---the inflation trend and the equilibrium real short rate---affect
interest rates. Although our framework is quite parsimonious---with few
risk factors, no stochastic volatility, and strong risk pricing restrictions---it
is sufficient to provides some important testable predictions about fundamental
aspects of the relationship between the trend in inflation, the equilibrium
real rate, and the yield curve.

We model inflation, $\pi_t$, as the sum of trend, cycle, and noise
components:
\[ \pi_{t+1} = \pi^\ast_t + c_t + e_{t+1}, \quad \pi^\ast_t =
\pi^\ast_{t-1} + \xi_t, \quad c_t = \phi_c c_{t-1} + u_t, \]
where the innovations $\xi_t$ and $u_t$ and the noise component $e_t$
are mutually independent \emph{iid} normal random variables with
standard deviations $\sigma_\xi$, $\sigma_u$ and $\sigma_e$. Inflation
expectations are $E_t \pi_{t+h+1} = \pi^\ast_t + \phi_c^h c_t$, and
$\underset{h \rightarrow \infty}{\lim} E_t \pi_{t+h}=\pi^\ast_t$ is
the time-varying inflation endpoint, which can be viewed as the perceived
inflation target of the central bank. This specification of the
inflation process is similar to the one in
\cite{duffee-inflation-risk}, and in line with the modern empirical
macro literature that allows for a trend component in inflation
\citep[a prominent example is][]{stock-watson-ucsv}. We assume that
the shocks $\xi_t$ and $u_t$ affect only expectations of future
inflation but not current inflation, which will slightly simplify the
bond pricing formulas.

The one-period real rate, $r_t$, also has a trend
component, the equilibrium real rate $r_t^\ast$, and a stationary
component, the cyclical real-rate gap $g_t$:
\[ r_t = r^\ast_t + g_t, \quad r^\ast_t = r^\ast_{t-1} + \eta_t, \quad
g_t = \phi_g g_{t-1} + v_t. \]
The shocks are again mutually uncorrelated and \emph{iid} normal, with
standard deviations $\sigma_\eta$ and $\sigma_v$. Since
$\underset{h \rightarrow \infty}{\lim} E_t r_{t+h} = r_t^\ast$, the
equilibrium real rate, also called the natural rate, can be understood
as the real rate that prevails in the economy after all shocks have
died out; see, for example, \cite{laubach-williams}.

Formally, of course, this specification includes an exact unit root in
inflation and the real rate. We view this assumption merely as a convenient
way to model very persistent processes.  The use of unit roots
simplifies the exposition of our model and the arguments regarding
trend components but it is not crucial.
Taken literally, a unit root specification is implausible because
the forecast error variances of inflation and real rates do not increase
linearly with the forecast horizon as predicted by a unit root. Instead, both
variables have always remained within certain bounds.
However, in finite samples, a
stationary process can always be approximated
arbitrarily well by a unit root process
\citep[e.g.,][]{campbell-perron}.\footnote{It is also
well known that assuming a unit root for a variable that in truth is
persistent but stationary can be very beneficial for forecasting.}
Thus, $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$
can be viewed simply as highly persistent components of $\pi_t$ and
$r_t$, which capture expectations at those long horizons that are relevant in
practice, even if infinite-horizon expectations are constant.

% In our context, even if we could measure expectations well, we could obviously never hope to learn from the data about $E_t \pi_{t+h}$ or $E_t r_{t+h}$ for infinitely large $h$.

The final state variable determining interest rates is a risk price
factor $x_t$, which follows an independent autoregressive process:\footnote{Here,
  we closely follow the model in CP, which also features a stand-alone,
  stationary single factor driving bond risk premiums. In other respects,
  the two key differences between our model and the CP model is that we
  allow for time variation in $r^\ast$ and that we use a general trend-cycle
  specification for inflation.}
\[ x_t = \mu_x + \phi_x x_{t-1} + w_t, \]
where $v_t$ is \emph{iid} normal with standard deviation
$\sigma_w$. The state variables can be collected as
$Z_t = (\pi^\ast_t, c_t, r^\ast_t, g_t, x_t)'$, and their dynamics can
be compactly written as a VAR(1)
\begin{equation}
 Z_t = \mu + \phi Z_{t-1} + \Sigma \varepsilon_t, \label{eq:var}
\end{equation}
where $\mu = (0,0,0,0,\mu_x)'$, $\phi = diag(1,\phi_c,1,\phi_g, \phi_x)$,
$\Sigma = diag(\sigma_\xi, \sigma_u, \sigma_\eta, \sigma_v, \sigma_w)$,
and
$\varepsilon_t$ is a $(5 \times 1)$ \emph{iid} standard normal vector process.

The model is completed by a specification for the log real stochastic
discount factor (SDF), $m_{t+1}^r$, for which we choose the usual
essentially affine form of \cite{duffee02}:
\[ m_{t+1}^r = -r_t - \frac{1}{2} \lambda_t'\lambda_t -
\lambda_t'\varepsilon_{t+1}, \quad \lambda_t = \Sigma^{-1} (\lambda_0
+ \lambda_1 Z_t). \]
Like CP, we only allow $x_t$ to affect the price of risk, so that the
first four columns of $\lambda_1$ are zero. Furthermore, shocks to
$x_t$ are not priced, so that the last element of $\lambda_0$ and the
last row of $\lambda_1$ are zero. The non-zero elements of $\lambda_0$
are denoted by $\lambda_{0\pi^\ast}, \lambda_{0c}, \lambda_{0 r^\ast},$ and
$\lambda_{0 g}$, and those of $\lambda_1$ by
$\lambda_{\pi^\ast x}, \lambda_{cx}, \lambda_{r^\ast x},$ and $\lambda_{g x}$.

The log nominal SDF is $m_{t+1}^n = m_{t+1}^r - \pi_{t+1}$ and the nominal
short-term interest rate is
\[ i_t = - E_t m_{t+1}^n - \frac{1}{2} Var_t (m_{t+1}^n) = r^\ast_t +
g_t + \pi^\ast_t +c_t - \frac{1}{2} \sigma_e^2. \]
Due to our timing assumption for the inflation process, and because
the noise shocks $e_t$ are not priced, there is no inflation risk
premium in the nominal short rate.\footnote{That is, $Cov_t(m_{t+1}^r,
  \pi_{t+1}) = 0$. CP make the same
  assumption, which is justified because estimates of this short-run inflation
  risk premium are typically very small.} Prices of
zero-coupon bonds with maturity $n$, denoted by $P_t^{(n)}$, are easily
verified to be exponentially affine, i.e., $\log(P_t^{(n)}) = A_n +
B_n'Z_t$, using the pricing equation $P_t^{(n+1)} =
E_t(\exp(m_{t+1}^n)P_{t+1}^{(n)})$. The
coefficients follow the usual recursions of affine term structure models \citep[e.g.,][]{angpiazzesi}:
\[ A_{n+1} = A_n + B_n' (\mu - \lambda_0) + C_n, \quad C_n :=
\frac{1}{2} (\sigma_e^2 + B_n' \Sigma \Sigma' B_n), \quad B_{n+1} =
-(1,1,1,1,0)' + (\phi - \lambda_1)'B_n, \] where $C_n$ captures the
convexity in bond prices. The initial conditions are
$A_0=0, B_0 = (0,0,0,0,0)'$. For the individual loadings of bond prices on the risk
factors we have
\[ B_{n+1}^{\pi^\ast} = B_{n}^{\pi^\ast} - 1, \quad B_{n+1}^c = \phi_c
B_n^c -1, \quad B_{n+1}^{r^\ast} =
B_n^{r^\ast} - 1, \quad B_{n+1}^g = \phi_g B_n^g - 1,\]
\[ B_{n+1}^x = -\lambda_{\pi^\ast x} B_n^{\pi^\ast} -\lambda_{cx}
B_n^c - \lambda_{r^\ast x} B_n^{r^\ast} - \lambda_{gx} B_n^g + \phi_x
B_n^x, \] and the explicit solutions are
\begin{gather*}
 B_n^{\pi^\ast} = -n, \quad B_n^c = \frac{\phi^n_c -
  1}{1-\phi_c},\quad B_n^{r^\ast} = -n, \quad B_n^g = \frac{\phi^n_g -
  1}{1-\phi_g},\\
B_n^x = \frac{\lambda_{\pi^\ast x} +
\lambda_{r^\ast x}}{1-\phi_x}\left(n - \frac{1-\phi_x^n}{1-\phi_x}\right)
+ \frac{\lambda_{cx}}{1-\phi_c}\left( \frac{1-\phi_x^n}{1-\phi_x} -
  \frac{\phi_x^n - \phi_c^n}{\phi_x - \phi_c} \right)
+ \frac{\lambda_{gx}}{1-\phi_g}\left( \frac{1-\phi_x^n}{1-\phi_x} -
  \frac{\phi_x^n - \phi_g^n}{\phi_x - \phi_g} \right).
\end{gather*}
For nominal bond yields the model implies the following decomposition:
\begin{eqnarray}
y_t^{(n)} &=& -\log(P_t^{(n)})/n = -A_n/n - B_n'Z_t/n \nonumber \\
&=&  \underbrace{\pi_t^\ast + \frac{1-\phi_c^n}{n(1-\phi_c)}
    c_t}_{\sum_{i=1}^n E_t \pi_{t+i}/n} +
    \underbrace{r_t^\ast + \frac{1-\phi_g^n}{n(1-\phi_g)}
    g_t}_{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} E_t r_{t+i}/n} \quad \underbrace{ -A_n/n
    - B_n^x x_t/n.}_{\text{convexity and yield term premium}} \label{eq:yields}
\end{eqnarray}
Equation \eqref{eq:yields} clearly shows the role of the trend
and cyclical components of inflation and real rates, and of the
risk-premium factor, for interest rates at different maturities. The
trend components $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$ naturally act as
level factors by affecting yields of all maturities
equally.\footnote{The constant loadings of yields on the trend variables
  shows that unit roots are also present under the risk-neutral measure.
  Strictly speaking, this is inconsistent with absence of arbitrage---see
  \cite{dybvig-ingersoll-ross} and \citet[][p.~433]{campbell-lo-mackinlay}---because
  the convexity in
  $-A_n/n$ diverges to minus infinity. However, as in the case of the
  real-world measure, our predictions are unaffected if the largest
  roots under the risk-neutral measure are taken to be very close to
  but below one.} The cyclical components $c_t$ and $g_t$ are slope factors as
they affect short-term yields more strongly than long-term yields;
their loadings approach zero for large $n$. The risk-premium factor
affects long-term yields more strongly than short-term
yields.\footnote{The loadings of yields on
  $x_t$ start at zero and tend to
  $\underset{n \rightarrow \infty}{\lim} -B_x^n/n =
  -(\lambda_{\pi^\ast x} + \lambda_{r^\ast x})/(1-\phi_x)$.}
Thus, long-term interest rates are mostly driven by the trend
components $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$, as well as by the transitory
risk-premium factor $x_t$. They are affected to a much lesser degree
than short-term yields by the
cyclical factors $c_t$ and $g_t$. Appendix \ref{app:dtsm} provides
additional details and results for this affine model, including
expressions for forward rates. In our empirical analysis we will focus
on long-term (five-year and ten-year) yields as well as long-term
(five-to-ten-year) forward rates, since these will exhibit the closest
relationship with $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$.

The model implies several predictions about the relationship between
interest rates and the two macroeconomic trends. However, these
predictions will be evident in the data only to the
extent that there is material variation in the trend
components. Furthermore, an empirical assessment requires accurate
estimates of $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$ (in Section
\ref{sec:data} we describe our empirical proxies). Thus, our empirical
analysis should be viewed as tests of the joint hypothesis that (a) the behavior of the trend
components and their links to the yield curve conform to our
no-arbitrage model, (b) variation in the trend components is
quantitatively important, and (c) our empirical proxies accurately
capture the evolution of the trend components.

A first straightforward prediction of the model is that for any yield
maturity $n$, the detrended yield $y_t^{(n)} - \pi^\ast_t - r^\ast_t$
will be much less persistent than the yield itself. The difference in
persistence is particularly pronounced for long-term yields or forward rates,
which place a heavy weight on the trend components. Strictly speaking,
under the unit root specification, $y_t^{(n)}$ is I(1) while
$y_t^{(n)} - \pi^\ast_t - r^\ast_t$ is I(0). Furthermore, a regression
of $y_t^{(n)}$ on $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$ is a cointegrating
regression that should recover unit coefficients, since the cointegrating
vector of $(y_t^{(n)}, \pi^\ast_t, r^\ast_t)$ is $(1, -1, -1)$.
The model also predicts that a partial detrending with only the inflation
trend will be much less successful. Namely, $y_t^{(n)} - \pi^\ast_t$
will exhibit substantial persistence. Similarly, a regression of
$y_t^{(n)}$ on $\pi^\ast_t$ is a spurious regression that will not
recover a unit coefficient and will produce residuals that remain highly
persistent. We will investigate these predictions empirically in Section
\ref{sec:cointegration}.

The fact that interest rates do not have a constant mean but contain the
stochastic trend $i^\ast_t = \pi^\ast_t + r^\ast_t$ also has important
implications for yield forecasts. From \eqref{eq:var} and
\eqref{eq:yields} we have
\[ \underset{h
  \rightarrow \infty}{\lim} E_t y^{(n)}_{t+h} = \text{constant} +
\pi^\ast_t + r^\ast_t,
\]
so interest rates mean-revert to a ``shifting endpoint''
\citep{kozicki-tinsley} that is driven by $i^\ast_t$. Note that the
constant in principle depends on the maturity $n$ but in practice is
sufficiently small that it can be neglected. The model predicts that long-horizon interest
rate forecasts that incorporate knowledge of $i^\ast_t$ are more
accurate than forecasts that ignore it. In particular, long-range
forecasts that account for $i^\ast_t$ should improve upon the common
forecast benchmark of a random walk. We will examine these forecast performance
issues in Section \ref{sec:forecasting}.

A third area in which macro trends may be empirically relevant is in
predicting excess bond returns. The pathbreaking work of CP
documented large predictive gains by including their measure of
trend inflation. In our model, as in the CP model, excess
bond returns, $rx_{t+1}^{(n)}$, are driven only by the risk premium factor $x_t$:
\[rx_{t+1}^{(n)} = p_{t+1}^{(n-1)} - p_t^{(n)} - y_t^{(1)}
= - \frac{1}{2} B_{n-1}' \Sigma \Sigma' B_{n-1} + B_{n-1}'(\lambda_0 +
\lambda_1 \iota_5)x_t + B_{n-1}'\Sigma \varepsilon_{t+1}, \]
where $p^{(n)}_t$ denotes the log-price of a zero-coupon bond with maturity
of $n$ quarters and $\iota_5$ is a $(5 \times 1)$-vector of ones. The better
performance found by CP in predicting excess bond returns with trend inflation
suggests that accounting for the trend component helps to identify
information about expected returns (i.e., the risk-premium factor)
that is contained in observed interest rates. However, according to our model, the
equilibrium real rate can drive nominal yields in the same fashion as
the trend component of inflation. Therefore, our model's prediction is
that including not only $\pi^\ast_t$ but also
$r^\ast_t$ should improve the ability of predictive regressions to
capture variation in bond risk premia. We assess the role of both trend
components for return predictability in Section \ref{sec:returns}.

Finally, the model predicts that macroeconomic trends should play a
particularly important role in accounting for interest rate changes
at low frequencies. The trend components are highly
persistent, so while their influence can be obscured by transitory
volatility at higher frequencies (e.g., quarterly changes), they should
dominant drivers of interest rate changes over longer intervals (e.g., over a
decade or more). This pattern implies that variance ratios of changes in the trend
components relative to changes in interest rates should exhibit a
pronounced tendency to rise with the period of the change. In Section
\ref{sec:horizons} we will use such variance
ratios, \citep[similar to the one
suggested by][]{duffee-inflation-risk}, to estimate the importance of the
trend components at different frequencies.

\section{Data and trend estimates}
\label{sec:data}

We now describe the data we will use in our investigation of the
relation between long-term interest rates and macroeconomic
trends. Our data set is quarterly and extends from 1971:Q4 to
2015:Q4.\footnote{We use a similar start date as CP to keep our
  analysis comparable to theirs.} The interest rate data are the smoothed zero-coupon Treasury
yields from \cite{gsw} with maturities from one to 15 years. We
complement this data with three- and six-month Treasury bill rates from the Federal Reserve's
H.15 data. We use end-of-quarter interest rates. The ten-year yield is plotted in Figure
\ref{fig:data1}. It exhibits the well-known pattern of a
pronounced increase over the 1970s with a spike in the early 1980s,
and a more or less continuous decrease over the following three
decades. To explain this secular downward trend is an important
objective of our paper.

For estimation of long-run inflation expectations a host of different
methods is available, which mostly rely on surveys, statistical
models, or a combination of the two---see, for example,
\cite{stock-watson-2015} and the references therein. In this paper we
will focus on a mostly survey-based measure, namely PTR, the
\underline{p}erceived inflation \underline{t}arget \underline{r}ate in
the Federal Reserve's FRB/US large-scale macroeconomic model. PTR
measures long-run expectations of inflation in the price index of
personal consumption expenditure (PCE), and is often used in empirical
work---see, for example, the handbook chapter of \cite{clark-mccracken}. Since 1979 (i.e., for most of
our sample) PTR is based exclusively on survey expectations.\footnote{Before 1979
  PTR is based on estimates from the learning model for expected
  inflation of \cite{kozicki-tinsley}. From 1979 to 1991:Q3
  expectations are taken from the Hoey survey, and thereafter from the
  from the Philadelphia Fed's Survey of Professional
  Forecasters. Before 2007 expectations are available only for CPI
  inflation, and PTR makes an adjustment for the CPI-PCE differential
  by subtracting 0.4 percentage points from the expectations for CPI
  inflation. For more details on the construction of PTR, see
  \cite{brayton-tinsley}. PTR can be downloaded at
  \url{https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/frbus/us-models-package.htm}.}
Figure \ref{fig:data1} shows that from the beginning of our sample to
the late 1990s, this estimate mostly mirrored the increase and
decrease in the ten-year yield. Since then, however, it has been
essentially flat at the level of two percent, which in 2012 was
announced as the long-run inflation target of the FOMC. Other survey
expectations of inflation over the long run, such as the long-range
forecasts in the Blue Chip survey, exhibit a similar pattern.

Estimation of the natural real interest rate is more
challenging. Survey-based estimates require long-run expectations of
both nominal interest rates and inflation, but the former are not
available for a sufficiently long time span.\footnote{The longest
  history is available for the biannual long-range expectations in
  Blue Chip Financial Forecasts, which start in 1986.} In addition,
long-range survey forecasts of nominal interest rates also tend to be
more erratic and less accurate than forecast of inflation \citep[see,
for example][]{dijk-etal}. Modern approaches for estimation of
$r^\ast_t$ typically rely on statistical models, often with structural
underpinnings. A popular example is the model of
\cite{laubach-williams}, in which the unobserved natural rate is inferred from
macroeconomic data using the Kalman filter. In Figure
\ref{fig:data2} we plot the one-sided/filtered Laubach-Williams
estimate of $r_t^\ast$.\footnote{This filtered estimate is obtained
  using only past and contemporaneous information, whereas the
  two-sided/smoothed estimate incorporates information from the
  whole sample. Note, however, that both estimates are conditional
  upon estimates of the model parameters which are obtained using the
  full sample.} In addition we also consider the estimates of
\cite{lubik-mathes}, who employ a time-varying parameter VAR model,
\cite{kiley}, who augments the Laubach-Williams model with a
measure of financial conditions, and \cite{johannsen-mertens}, who use a shadow-rate term structure
model to account for the lower bound on nominal interest rates. Figure
\ref{fig:data2} shows that early in the sample, until the early 1980s,
the measures differ markedly, but that subsequently they evolve in
broadly similar fashion. We calculate the average of these four
estimates, which is a simple but effective way to aggregate the various
approaches and information into one measure. This average is the
measure of $r^\ast_t$ which we will use in our analysis in Sections \ref{sec:cointegration}--\ref{sec:horizons}.

A compelling story emerges from the evolution of long-term nominal
interest rates and estimates of the trends in inflation and the real
rate since the Volcker disinflation of the 1980s: Both interest rates
and inflation exhibited a downward trend until about the turn of the
millenium. Around that time long-run inflation expectations became
firmly anchored near two percent, but long-term interest rates
continued to decrease. The explanation is found in a substantial
decline in the natural real interest rate. All four estimates of
$r^\ast_t$ fell more or less continuously over the period from 2000 to
2015, with the decline ranging between 1.6 and 3.2 percentage points,
with an average of 2.3. Over the same period the ten-year yield fell
by 3.8 percentage points. A decline in the term premium and near-term
expectations of real rates and inflation likely contributed to this
fall. But according to our estimates it seems clear that $r_t^\ast$
played a crucial role in explaining the second half of the decline in
long-term interest rates in the U.S.~over the last 30 years.

\section{Persistence in long-term yields from $r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$} % and cointegration}
\label{sec:cointegration}

If the trend components of inflation and the real interest rate play
an important role in driving interest rates, then these trends should
exhibit a close statistical relationship with long-term interest rates
and account for most of their persistence. A natural starting point
for assessing this relationship is to consider simple regressions of
yields on measures of the trend components. Table \ref{tab:reg}
reports the results for such regressions with three different
dependent variables: bond yields with 5 and 10 years maturity, and the
5-to-10-year forward rate. For each maturity, we estimate two versions
of the regressions (with standard errors calculated using the
Newey-West estimator with six lags). The first version has only a
constant and $\pi^\ast_t$ as regressors, which is the same regression
that CP estimated using their simple moving-average estimate of the
inflation trend (see their table 1). The second version adds
$r^\ast_t$ as a regressor. Our results from the first regression confirm the
findings of CP, namely, high $R^2$'s at all maturities and
$\pi^\ast_t$ coefficients that are just above one and highly
significant.\footnote{Our estimated coefficients on $\pi^\ast_t$ are
  somewhat higher than in CP because our measure of the inflation
  trend is less variable, though when $r^\ast_t$ is added, the
  estimated coefficients for $\pi^\ast_t$ decrease toward one.} CP
interpret these results as indicating that trend inflation drives the
level of yield curve, but our second version of this regression shows
that incorporating a trend real rate is also important. With the
addition of $r^\ast_t$ to each of the regressions, both trend
coefficients are highly significant, and the regression $R^2$'s
increase by between 8 and 13 percentage points.

Taken at face value, these estimates suggest that changes in
$r^\ast_t$ along with changes in $\pi^\ast_t$, are key sources of
variation in long-term interest rates.
However, the interpretation of these results is complicated by the fact
that all of the variables in the regressions are highly
persistent. Conventional asymptotic arguments, which justify inference
based on the Newey-West standard errors and $R^2$'s in Table \ref{tab:reg},
are not valid if some of the variables contain
autoregressive roots close to or equal to one. Under the assumptions
of the model in Section \ref{sec:model}, the static regressions
estimate the cointegrating relationships between long-term interest
rates, inflation, and real rates.\footnote{Much empirical work, for example, \cite{kpsw},
has documented the substantial persistence in nominal interest rates,
inflation, and real interest rates. The main difference between
our static regressions and the usual cointegration regressions in this
context \citep[as in][for example]{rose} is that we use directly observable
proxies for the trend components of $\pi_t$ and $r_t$.} If there is a
cointegrating relationship among the variables of such a regression, then the
regression provides super-consistent estimates of the cointegrating
vector, the $R^2$ converges to one, and conventional
hypothesis tests are likely invalid for inference about the
coefficients \citep[e.g.,][Chapter 19]{hamilton}. Consequently, the
regression results in Table \ref{tab:reg}---although suggestive of the
joint importance of $r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$ for the determination
of yields---cannot provide definitive answers.

As a first step to provide more compelling statistical evidence that
our measures of $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$ capture the persistent
variation in interest rates, we compare the time series properties of long-term
interest rates with no detrending to the series with one or both of the trend
components subtracted out. For the same three maturities considered above,
Table \ref{tab:detrended} includes both simple differences as the
detrended series, that is, assuming unit coefficients on $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$,
as well as the residuals from the static regressions in Table \ref{tab:reg}.
For each series, Table \ref{tab:detrended} reports the standard deviation and two measures of
persistence: the estimated first-order autocorrelation coefficient,
$\hat{\rho}$, and the half-life, which
indicates the number of quarters until half of a given shock has died
out and is calculated as $\ln(0.5)/\ln(\hat{\rho})$.
Several findings stand out: First, detrending with $r^\ast_t$ as well as
$\pi^\ast_t$ accounts for noticeably more persistence, typically
reducing the half-life by about 40-50\%. That is, $\pi^\ast_t$ is
not the only important driver of interest rate persistence. Second, the detrended series are
substantially less variable and less persistent than the original
interest rate series. For example, shocks to the ten-year yield have a
half-life of about 5-1/2 years, whereas shocks to the series that is
the difference of this yield and the trend components have a half-life
of only 1-1/4 years. Finally, there is little difference in the statistical
properties between the series that are detrended using unit
coefficients and those that are detrended using estimated
coefficients, in particular for the forward rate.

Unit root tests provide further evidence supporting the detrending with both $r^\ast_t$
and $\pi^\ast_t$. We calculate parametric Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) $t$-statistics
and non-parametric Phillips-Perron (PP) $Z_\alpha$ statistics to examine
the persistence and integration properties of these series by testing
the null hypothesis of a unit autoregressive root.\footnote{For the ADF
test, we include a constant and $k$ lagged difference in the test
regression, where $k$ is determined using the general-to-specific procedure
suggested by \cite{ng-perron-95}. We start with $k=4$ quarterly lags and
reduce the number of lags until the coefficient on the last lag is
significant at the ten percent level. For the PP test, we use a
Newey-West estimator of the long-run variance with four lags.
When the series under consideration is a residual from
an estimated cointegration regression, we don't include intercepts in
the ADF or PP regression equations and use the critical values provided by
\cite{phillips-ouliaris}, which depend on the number of regressors in
the cointegration equation.} These tests show strong evidence against the
unit root null for the series that are detrended with both
$\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$. By contrast, the unit root null is never rejected
at the 10 percent level for the original interest rate series or for
series that are detrended by only $\pi^\ast_t$. This supports the use of
both the $r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$ trends for accounting for interest rate
persistence and for understanding interest rate dynamics. Finally, with
the exception of the five-year yield, the rejections are equally
strong or stronger for the series that are detrended using unit
coefficients as for the residuals from the static regressions.

%While it is clear that both estimated trend components are closely
%related to interest rates, our premise is that this is because they
%capture the trends in inflation and real rates. To check this, we also
%calculated the same statistics for the trend estimates themselves, for
%observed inflation $\pi_t$ and an estimate of the ex-ante real rate
%$r_t$, and the differences $\pi_t - \pi^\ast_t$ and $r_t -
%r^\ast_t$. Inflation is taken as the year-over-year percentage change
%in the Core CPI infex. The ex-ante real rate is calculated as the
%difference between the one-year nominal Treasury yield and one-year
%inflation expectations from the Survey of Professional
%Forecasters. The results, shown in the bottom of Table
%\ref{tab:detrended}, reveal that detrended inflation is much less
%persistent than actual inflation, and a unit root null can be rejected
%for the detrended series. The detrended real rate is also less
%persistent than the actual real rate, and unit root rejections are
%more strongly significant. Particularly in light of the fact that we
%use off-the-shelf trend estimates which were not constructed with the goal of detrending
%these particular series, they
%are fairly successful at capturing the persistent
%components of inflation and the real rate.

In sum, macroeconomic trends capture a large share of the persistence
in long-term interest rates, and both $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$ are
needed to accurately capture the trend. One implication is that when
calculating the ``interest rate cycles'' suggested by CP---that is,
differences between long-term yields and their trend components---one needs to
account for both trend components. Instead, if the cycle is
simply calculated as the difference between an
interest rate and trend inflation, this purported cycle will still contain
an important trend component due to changes in the equilibrium real
interest rate. Another broad implication pertains to
cointegration. We strongly rejected the unit root hypothesis for
the series $y_t - \pi^\ast_t - r^\ast_t$ which is consistent with the prediction of our model
that long-term interest rates and the macroeconomic trend components
are cointegrated, and that the cointegrating vector equals
$(1, -1, -1)'$. A large literature has investigated the question whether
interest rates and inflation are cointegrated, and whether the real
rate has a unit root or is stationary, with conflicting results. Using
our proxies for the trend components in inflation and real rates, we
obtain clear, unambiguous results: both inflation and the real rate
contain trend components, and our proxies for these trend components
are related to interest rates exactly as standard finance theory
predicts.

\section{Forecasting interest rates with $r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$}
\label{sec:forecasting}

The previous section illustrated the strong persistence of interest rates and
the close link between that persistence and measures of the inflation trend,
$\pi^\ast_t$, and the equilibrium real rate, $r^\ast_t$. Here, we provide
additional forecast-based evidence supporting that result. Specifically,
our long-horizon forecast exercise confirms that interest rates
exhibit reversion to a time-varying mean or endpoint, which, in line
with the theory of Section \ref{sec:model}, equals $i^\ast_t = \pi^\ast_t +
r^\ast_t$.\footnote{The model in Section \ref{sec:model} implies that
  the endpoint equals a maturity-specific constant plus $i^\ast_t$,
  but our results show that it is not necessary to try to estimate and
  include this constant in the endpoint to obtain accurate forecasts.}
Our results also show that accounting only
for the variation in $\pi^\ast_t$ is insufficient, and that information
in $r^\ast_t$ needs to be taken into account.

We forecast three different long-term interest rates, the five-year
and ten-year yields, and the five-to-ten-year forward rate. At each
point in time $t$, starting at $t=20$ when five years of data is
available, we forecast each interest rate $y_t$ at horizons from $h=1$
to $h=40$ quarters. As usual in this literature, the benchmark (method
1) is a driftless random walk model, i.e., the forecast
$\hat{y}_{t+h} = y_t$ for all $h$. We consider two alternative
forecast methods which assume that interest rates mean-revert to a
time-varying endpoint $\hat{\imath}_t$. Method 2 assumes that this
endpoint is only driven by the inflation trend, i.e., that
$\hat{\imath}_t$ equals $\pi^\ast_t$ plus a constant. We estimate this
constant recursively as the mean of $y_\tau - \pi^\ast_\tau$, using
observations from $\tau=1$ to $\tau=t$.\footnote{We have found in
  additional, unreported results that forecasts which assume that this
  constant is zero perform much worse than this method.} Method 3
instead assumes that the endpoint is
$\hat{\imath}_t = i^\ast_t = \pi^\ast_t + r^\ast_t$. For both forecast methods, the
speed of mean-reversion is recursively estimated as the first-order
autocorrelation coefficient of $y_t - \hat{\imath}_t$. Denoting this
coefficient as $\hat{\rho}_t$ the forecasts for methods 2 and 3 are
constructed as
$\hat{y}_{t+h} = \hat{\rho}_t^h y_t + (1-\hat{\rho}_t^h) \hat{\imath}_t$. We
note that the exact value/method for $\hat{\rho}_t$ affects only
short-horizon forecasts and has no impact on our main results.

Table \ref{tab:yield_forecasts} reports the results of this
forecasting exercise in terms of root-mean-squared errors (RMSEs) and
mean-absolute errors (MAEs), in percentage points. We also calculate
$p$-values for tests of equal finite-sample forecast accuracy
using the approach of \cite{diebold-mariano} (DM), following common use with a rectangular window
for the long-run variance and the small-sample adjustment of
\cite{harvey-leybourne-newbold}.\footnote{Monte Carlo evidence in
  \cite{clark-mccracken} indicates that this test has good size in finite
  samples. However, for very long forecast horizons there are of
  course only few non-overlapping observations in our sample, so the
  $p$-values should be taken with a grain of salt.} We calculate DM
$p$-values, using standard normal critical values, for
one-sided tests of whether forecasts using the endpoint $\pi^\ast_t +
r^\ast_t$ (method 3) improve upon random walk forecasts (method 1) and forecasts that use
only $\pi^\ast_t$ for the endpoint (method 2). We find that method 3
leads to gains in forecast accuracy at long horizons that are both
substantial and highly significant. Such gains are present for both
RMSEs and MAEs, but are larger and more strongly significant for
absolute-error loss. For example, when forecasting the ten-year yield
five years ahead, using the information in $\pi^\ast_t+r^\ast_t$ decreases the RMSE by over 25\%
relative to the random walk forecast, an improvement that is
significant at the five-percent level, while the MAE is decreased by
more than 40\% with significance at the one percent level. This
forecast method also improves upon method 2, which does not use the
information in $r^\ast_t$, and the improvement is typically large and
often significant.

This forecast exercise thus confirms that interest rates
exhibit reversion to a time-varying endpoint of $\pi^\ast_t +
r^\ast_t$. Earlier authors, such as \cite{dijk-etal}, have found
that when forecasting interest rates it is beneficial to link long-run
projections of interest rates to long-run expectations of
inflation. Our new result shows that including $r^\ast_t$ along
with $\pi^\ast_t$ improves on long-horizon interest rate
forecasting to an even greater degree. Furthermore, while earlier
authors run regressions of the
level of interest rates on long-run inflation expectations, we have
shown that no scaling or estimation is necessary for accurate long-range
forecasts if the endpoint is simply taken as $\pi^\ast_t +
r^\ast_t$.\footnote{Our approach could easily be extended to jointly forecast the
whole yield curve as in \cite{diebold-li} and \cite{dijk-etal}, by simply forecasting the
Nelson-Siegel level factor in the same fashion that we have forecast
each individual interest rate above.}

Finally, it is useful to consider our results from the statistical
standpoint of integration and cointegration. Our results in Table \ref{tab:detrended}
generally could not reject the unit root hypothesis for interest rates,
inflation and real rates. Furthermore, these three series appear to be
cointegrated, since interest rates that are detrended using our
proxies for the trends in inflation and real rates
show fast mean-reversion. We need not claim the presence of exact
unit roots, but our results suggest that empirical models and forecasts of
the yield curve may perform better in finite samples if one assumes
the presence of unit roots and cointegration instead of
stationarity.\footnote{This follows from the well-known argument in
  empirical finance and macroeconomics, elucidated for example in
  \cite{campbell-perron}, that while highly persistent and integrated
  series are indistinguishable in finite samples it can be beneficial
  for forecasting to assume a unit root for a persistent but stationary
  series.} A common finding in empirical practice, due to the high persistence of
interest rates, is that the assumption of a random walk leads to competitive forecasts that are
difficult to beat
\citep{duffee02,diebold-li,duffee-handbook-forecasting}. But our
results show that the added assumption of cointegration and the
use of our empirical proxies for the macroeconomic trends inherent in
interest rates leads to substantially better long-term forecasts than
the use of random walks.

\section{Predicting bond returns with $r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$}
\label{sec:returns}

We now turn to the role of macroeconomic trends for predicting bond
returns. According to CP, proxies for the
inflation trend appear to have significant predictive power for annual
excess bond returns, above and beyond the information contained in the
yield curve itself. Since $r^\ast_t$ also is an important trend
driving long-term interest rates, it is natural to ask what role it
plays in such predictive regressions. We revisit CP's analysis and
address this larger question.

We predict excess returns for holding periods of one quarter and four
quarters. The excess return for a holding period of $h$ quarters for
a bond with maturity $n$ is calculated as
\[
  rx_{t, t+h}^{(n)} = p_{t+h}^{(n-h)} - p_t^{(n)} - h y_t^{(h)} =
  -(n-h)y_{t+h}^{(n-h)} + n y_t^{(n)} - h y_t^{(h)}.
\]
Our long-term bond yields are available only at annual maturities, so
we calculate one-quarter returns with the usual approximation
$y_{t+1}^{(n-1)} \approx y_{t+1}^{(n)}$. Our dependent variable is the
average excess return for bonds with two to 15 years
maturity.\footnote{CP focused on annual holding periods, using a
  monthly data set and used a weighted average that downweights
  longer-term bonds. Our simple average made no material
  difference to the results and is more common in
  this literature. Finally, our sample period is similar to
  the one considered in CP but extends to 2015.}
We estimate three specifications of the predictive
regressions: The first includes a constant and the first three
principal components (PCs) of yields. This common baseline regression
is motivated by work going back to \cite{famabliss} and
\cite{campbellshiller91} which showed that there is information in the
yield curve itself, and in particular in its slope (PC2), about
expected bond returns. The second specification adds $\pi^\ast_t$ and
is closely related to the specifications including an inflation trend
that were estimated by CP. In our third specification we also include
$r^\ast_t$, in order to simultaneously capture the effects of both macroeconomic trends
in the regression.

The top panel of Table \ref{tab:returns} reports the estimation
results for the full sample. We calculate White's heteroskedasticity-robust standard
errors for the case of one-quarter returns and Newey-West
standard errors with six lags for the four-quarter returns (since
the overlap introduces serial correlations in the error term). Our
results replicate CP's main finding, namely that inclusion
of the inflation trend raises the predictive power quite substantially
in comparison to a regression that only includes yield-curve
information, and that both the inflation trend and the level of yields
(PC1) appear highly significant.

Adding $r^\ast_t$ to the regression leads to impressive
further gains in predictive power. For both one-quarter and
four-quarter returns, the $R^2$ increases substantially, the
coefficients and $t$-statistics for $\pi^\ast_t$ and PC1 rise, and the
coefficient on $r^\ast_t$ itself is large and highly significant according
to Newey-West $t$-statistics. Interestingly, the coefficient on $r^\ast_t$ is about as large as
the coefficient on $\pi^\ast_t$, which confirms the theoretical
prediction that these two trends play roles of similar magnitude in determining interest rates.

It is well known that predictive regressions for bond returns raise
some knotty econometric issues. \cite{bauer-hamilton} show that the
small-sample inference is particularly problematic when the predictors are highly
persistent, like interest rates and our macro trends. They propose a
parametric bootstrap procedure to carry out robust
inference in such cases. It tests the null
hypothesis that only the information in the yield curve is
useful for predicting excess returns, and it can accurately
gauge the statistical significance of additional proposed
predictors. We follow their recommendation and calculate bootstrap
small-sample $p$-values for the coefficients on $\pi^\ast_t$ and
$r^\ast_t$. Our bootstrap simulates yields from a simple
VAR(1) factor model and the additional predictors from a separate
VAR(1) model, so that the null hypothesis holds by construction. The
predictive regression is estimated in each bootstrap sample and the
$t$-statistics for the additional predictors are recorded. With this
small-sample distribution of the test statistics in hand, $p$-values
are calculated as the fraction of simulated samples in
which the $t$-statistic is at least as large (in absolute value) as
the $t$-statistic in the actual data. These $p$-values, reported in
squared brackets in Table \ref{tab:returns}, indicate that both of our
trends are statistically significant even when we account for
small-sample econometric concerns.

According to the small-sample $p$-values, in the subsample starting in
1985, the inflation trend is not statistically significant when
included on its own.\footnote{This mirrors the finding of
  \cite{bauer-hamilton} who also revisited CP's evidence and showed
  that in a subsample starting in 1985 the inflation trend is only
  marginally significant according to their bootstrap small-sample
  inference.}  Only when we add our measure of the equilibrium real
rate, do both trends matter for bond risk premia; the coefficients on
$\pi^\ast_t$ and PC1 more than double, the $R^2$ increases
substantially, and the coefficients on $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$ are
statistically significant. These results confirm our intuition from
Figure \ref{fig:data1} that the real-rate trend has gained in
importance and significance over time as it has exhibited a pronounced
decline over the past twenty years while the trend in inflation has
been essentially constant. Therefore, empirical analysis of long-term
interest rates during that period implies that the trend in the real
interest rate is at least as important as, and recently more important
than, the trend in inflation.\footnote{In additional, unreported
  results we have found that the predictive gains from including
  $r^\ast_t$ are particularly large during the early 2000s when both
  $r^\ast_t$ and long-term interest rates decreased while long-run
  inflation expectations where anchored close to two percent.}

An important contribution of CP is that they estimated interest rate
cycles, defined as the de-trended or cyclical component in interest
rates, and showed that these cycles captured the predictive power in
interest rates and the inflation trend for future bond returns. They
estimated the interest rate cycles as the residuals of regressions of
interest rates on their measure of the inflation trend Our results
here and in the previous sections indicate that a better estimate of
the cycle is obtained by incorporating measures of both an inflation
trend and a real rate trend.  Furthermore, our results suggest that a
simple difference between a long-term interest rate and
$i^\ast_t = \pi^\ast_t + r^\ast_t$ is likely sufficient; there is no
need to run a regression to construct interest rate cycles. Such
estimates of interest rate cycles could, for example, be used to
construct a return-forecasting factor similar in spirit to the one
constructed by CP, which would better capture variation in bond risk
premia due to the fact that trend components are more accurately
accounted for.

An outstanding issue is why
information in $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$ is not spanned by the yield
curve. Unspanned risks in bond returns are an important current issue
in macro-finance; see \cite{duffee-handbook-forecasting}, \cite{jls}, \cite{jps}, and \cite{bauer-hamilton}.
CP and \cite{bauer-rudebusch-spanning} argue the lack of spanning reflects
measurement errors in yields, but there may be other, more
structural reasons. The incremental predictive power of macro trends and
the apparent failure of the spanning hypothesis may reflect some
underlying economic mechanisms related to the unobservable nature of trends.

In sum, accounting for the persistent components of yields is
important for understanding return predictability and estimation of
bond risk premia. We find that $r^\ast_t$ has strong incremental
predictive power for bond returns, about on par with the importance of
$\pi^\ast_t$ as a predictor, suggesting that in this context it is
important to account for not only the inflation trend but also estimates of the
equilibrium real rate.

\section{Variance contributions of $r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$}
\label{sec:horizons}

Using variance ratios for quarterly innovations in bond yields
\cite{duffee-inflation-risk} examines how much
the variance of news about future inflation contributes
to the variance of quarterly innovations to nominal bond yields.
He finds that such inflation variance ratios are surprisingly low.
We interpret his results in the context of our model and extend them
to explicitly consider movements in with $r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$.
We also provide a new perspective by considering variance ratios
at horizons greater than just one quarter. % new estimates of alternative
% variance ratios for variation at different frequencies. In this way we
% reconcile these different findings and obtain a new and different perspective on the empirical importance of
% the trend components. We also propose a different, model-free approach
% to estimate such variance ratios, based on observed changes in yields
% and the trend components instead of estimated surprise components

The variance ratio used by Duffee is
\[ VR_1^{(n)} = \frac{Var\left((E_t-E_{t-1})n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n
  \pi_{t+i}\right)}{Var\left((E_t-E_{t-1}) y_t^{(n)}\right)},
\]
the ratio of the variance of innovations to average inflation
expectations over $n$ periods to the variance of innovations to the
bond yield for maturity $n$. It measures the importance of quarterly
innovations about future inflation over the life of a bond for
variability in its yield. A more general variance ratio considers innovations over not
one but $h$ periods,
\[
  VR_h^{(n)} = \frac{Var\left((E_t-E_{t-h})n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n
    \pi_{t+i}\right)}{Var\left((E_t-E_{t-h}) y_t^{(n)}\right)},
\]
so that instead of one-period innovations the variances are for
innovations over $h$ periods. Our model implies:
\begin{eqnarray*}
  VR_1^{(n)} &=& \frac{\sigma_\xi^2 + a_c(n) \sigma_u^2}{\sigma_\xi^2
                 + a_c(n) \sigma_u^2 + \sigma_\eta^2 + a_g(n)
                 \sigma_v^2 + \left(\frac{B_n^x}{n}\right)^2
                 \sigma_w^2}, \\
  VR_h^{(n)} &=& \frac{h\sigma_\xi^2 + a_c(n)b_c(h) \sigma_u^2}{h\sigma_\xi^2 + a_c(n) b_c(h) \sigma_u^2 + h \sigma_\eta^2 + a_g(n) b_g(h) \sigma_v^2 + \left(\frac{B_n^x}{n}\right)^2 b_x(h) \sigma_w^2},\\
             && a_i(n) = \left(\frac{1-\phi_i^n}{n(1-\phi_i)}\right)^2, \quad b_i(h)
                = \frac{1-\phi_i^{2h}}{1-\phi_i^2}, \quad i = c, g, x.
\end{eqnarray*}
These expressions will help us understand the factors determining the variance ratios.

An important result of Duffee's analysis is that even for long-term
bonds, $VR_1^{(n)}$ appears to be small. This can be understood
through the lens of our model by noting that
\[
\underset{n \rightarrow \infty}{\lim} VR_1^{(n)} =
\frac{\sigma_\xi^2}{\sigma_\xi^2 + \sigma_\eta^2 + \left(
    \frac{\lambda_{\pi^\ast x} + \lambda_{r^\ast
        x}}{1-\phi_x}\right)^2 \sigma_w^2 }.
\]
This ratio will be small if shocks to the equilibrium real rate and to
the risk-premium factor make more important contributions to yield innovations than shocks
to the inflation trend. One plausible interpretation of Duffee's
finding is that at a quarterly frequency the trend in inflation
moves much less than the term premium component of long-term interest
rates. Such movements in the term premium, which is a catch-all
component for price movements not attributable to
changes in real-rate and inflation expectations, could be due to a
variety of factors including changes in risk-sentiment and ``animal spirits.'' This interpretation is
consistent with additional evidence in Duffee's paper on the role of
the term premium, and with a large body of evidence on excess
volatility of interest rates, going all the way back to
\cite{shiller-79}.

Another way to try to understand the role of inflation expectations
for bond yields is to consider longer horizons instead of one-period
innovations. This appears promising because
\[
\underset{h \rightarrow \infty}{\lim} VR_h^{(n)} =
\frac{\sigma_\xi^2}{\sigma_\xi^2 + \sigma_\eta^2},
\]
so that asymptotically this variance ratio is only affected by changes
in the trend components. Changes in term premia become irrelevant at
very low frequencies if, as in our model, the risk premium factor $x_t$ is stationary. Of course, looking at variance ratios for large $h$
instead of large $n$ is no magic bullet: we quickly loose degrees of
freedom and precision in our estimates when we increase $h$ and hence
the overlap of the observations. However, the profile of variance
ratios across horizons should give us additional insights about interest
rate dynamics, even if the maximum horizon is limited in practice by
data availability.

Estimation of the variance ratios suggested by Duffee and above
requires modeling expectations of inflation and interest rates. Here
we instead propose to calculate variance ratios based on observed
changes in the data. For example, using $\pi^\ast_t$ we can calculate
\[
\widetilde{VR}_h^{(n)} = \frac{Var\left(\Delta_h \pi^\ast_t\right)}{Var\left( \Delta_h
  y_t^{(n)}\right)}, \qquad \Delta_h z_t = z_t - z_{t-h}.
\]
For any given $n$ and $h$, $\widetilde{VR}_h^{(n)}$ differs from
$VR_h^{(n)}$ because the variances in the former include movements
that were anticipated at $t-h$. However, in practice these differences
are likely to be small for the following reasons. For long-term bonds we have
\[
\underset{n \rightarrow \infty}{\lim}\widetilde{VR}_1^{(n)} =
\frac{\sigma_\xi^2}{\sigma_\xi^2+\sigma_\eta^2 + \left(
    \frac{\lambda_{\pi^\ast x} + \lambda_{r^\ast x}}{1-\phi_x}
  \right)^2 \frac{2}{1+\phi_x} \sigma_w^2} \approx \underset{n
  \rightarrow \infty}{\lim}VR_1^{(n)},
\]
where the accuracy of the approximation depends on how close
$2/(1+\phi_x)$ is to one, i.e., on how persistent the risk-premium
factor $x_t$ is. If $x_t$ is not that persistent,
$\widetilde{VR}_h^{(n)}$ for a long-term bond is somewhat smaller than
the corresponding $VR_h^{(n)}$. Another justification for using
variance ratios of changes is the fact that
\[
\underset{h \rightarrow \infty}{\lim} \widetilde{VR}_h^{(n)} =
\frac{\sigma_\xi^2}{\sigma_\xi^2 + \sigma_\eta^2} = \underset{h
  \rightarrow \infty}{\lim} VR_h^{(n)},
\]
so that for low-frequency movements the two estimates are
asymptotically identical. In sum, variance ratios of changes are
easier to calculate than variance ratios of innovations, but help us
learn about the same features of the data. In addition, we can also calculate them for the real-rate trend or the
overall trend component, by simply using the sample variances
of changes in the observed $r^\ast_t$ or $i^\ast_t$ in the
numerator.

Figure \ref{fig:vr} shows sample variance ratios for the
five-year and ten-year yield, as well as for the 5-to-10-year forward
rate. We calculate variance ratios for changes in $\pi^\ast_t$,
$r^\ast_t$ and $i^\ast_t$, and for changes from one quarter to $h=40$
quarters.

For the inflation trend we find that one-quarter variance ratios are
around 0.1. This result is consistent with Duffee's
findings and indicates that changes in the inflation trend play a small role for variation in
yields at the quarterly frequency. When we consider changes at lower frequencies, however, we find that
movements in the inflation trend play a substantial role for changes
in interest rates. The point estimates of the $\pi^\ast_t$-variance
ratio quickly increase with the horizon, and for $h=40$ reach a
magnitude of around 0.3.

The variance ratio for changes in the real-rate trend, i.e.,
$Var \Delta r^\ast_t/Var\Delta_h y_t$, is much lower than the
one for the inflation trend, remaining below 0.1 even at the longest
horizon. This is unsurprising in light of Figure \ref{fig:data1},
which shows that over the full sample the movements in $r^\ast_t$ were
substantially less pronounced than movements in long-term interest
rates and the inflation trend.\footnote{This finding may be partially due to
our use of an average of different estimates for $r^\ast_t$---some of
the individual estimates exhibit distinctly more volatility.} Of
course, this perspective of unconditional
variances should not be taken to conclude that changes in the
equilibrium real rate are unimportant for interest rate dynamics,
given the ample evidence in Sections
\ref{sec:cointegration}--\ref{sec:returns} of the importance of
$r^\ast_t$ for modeling and forecasting interest
rates. Furthermore, since our evidence suggests that
$r^\ast_t$ has become a relatively more important driver of changes in
long-term interest rates over recent decades, we venture the guess
that conditional variance ratios would show a switch from $\pi^\ast_t$
to $r^\ast_t$ as the dominant driver of low-frequency
changes.\footnote{Due to the paucity of data, conditional
  variance ratios would need to be obtained using a model with
  stochastic volatility, in order to impose structure on variances across frequencies and
  increase the efficiency of the estimates (at the cost of possible
  misspecification).}

We now focus on the variance ratios
$Var \Delta i^\ast_t/Var \Delta y_t$ to assess the overall
importance of the trend components in interest rates. Confidence
intervals are obtained using the asymptotic distribution of the sample
variances and the delta method. To account for persistence in
conditional variances, Newey-West estimates of long-run variances are
used.\footnote{The choice of lag length is informed by the automatic
  lag selection procedure of Newey and West; we end up using 12
  quarterly lags for all long-run variance estimates.} We acknowledge
that these confidence intervals may understate the true sampling
variability due to the small number of nonoverlapping observations,
which decreases the reliability of the asymptotic approximations.
With this caveat in mind, Figure \ref{fig:vr} shows that while the sampling
uncertainty around the variance ratios for changes in $i^\ast_t$ is
substantial we can be reasonably confident that these
variance ratios increase from below 0.15 to a range of around 0.25 to
0.4, depending on the maturity of the interest rate. The highest
levels are reached for the 5-to-10-year forward rate---the
confidence interval at $h=40$ extends from about 0.3 to 0.4---which is
consistent with the notion that distant forward rates are more
strongly affected by the trend components.

Our model, like any model with a trend component for interest
rates, implies that the variance ratios for $i^\ast_t$ approach one
for sufficiently large $h$, but our estimates top out around
0.4. One possible explanation is
that we are simply not capturing the trend component with sufficient
accuracy. The true trend components might well be more (or
less) variable than the proxies we have available. However, we have provided
ample evidence that our trend proxies are closely linked to the
low-frequency movements in interest rates. A more plausible
explanation might be that the largest values of $h$ that we consider
are simply not large enough, which is a problem that we cannot solve without more data. At
the horizons we do provide estimates for, the estimates are increasing
substantially with $h$, but even at $h=40$ the cyclical/transitory
components of interest rates appear to still play a substantial
role. This could be due either to the cyclical components in inflation
and real rates, or, more likely, to the fact that the risk-premium
factor itself is sufficiently persistent/trending that it drives
interest rate variation at such low frequencies.

To shed additional light on the respective roles of trends and cycles
we report in Table \ref{tab:vr} the variances of changes in interest
rates, in the trend component $i^\ast_t$, and in the cycle components
$y_t - i^\ast_t$. The variance of yield changes can be decomposed as follows:
\[
Var(\Delta_h y_t) = Var(\Delta_h i^\ast_t) + Var(\Delta_h y_t -
\Delta_h i^\ast_t) + 2 Cov(\Delta_h i^\ast_t, \Delta_h y_t -
\Delta_h i^\ast_t).
\]
Table \ref{tab:vr} reports all three components. In the data, the contribution of the covariance is small
at short horizons, but substantial at long horizons. The two last
columns of Table \ref{tab:vr} report, first, the same variance ratio
shown in Figure \ref{fig:vr}, and second, a ratio that also includes
the covariance contribution in the numerator. This second ratio rises
to over 0.7 with horizon, which in turn implies that the cycle
component by itself explains only less than 30\% of the variance of
interest rate changes at low frequencies. These estimates raise some
additional questions, such as how to reconcile the strongly positive
covariance with our model, which assumes that shocks to trend and
cycle are uncorrelated.\footnote{Measurement error would have to be of
  a very specific form to explain this finding by itself, because classical measurement
  error in our estimate of $i^\ast_t$ would lead to a downward bias
  in the sample covariance.} But what seems clear from these results
is that while changes in the trend components are unimportant for
interest rate at high
frequencies (such as one-quarter changes), they play a crucially important role for
driving low-frequency movements in interest rates.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we have provided new evidence that interest rates are
closely related to two macroeconomic trends: the trend in inflation
(or the Fed's inflation target), and the equilibrium (or
natural/neutral) real rate of interest. Our empirical approach was to use
outside estimates from different sources as proxies for
these trend components, and then to investigate the
relationship between interest rates and these trend proxies from a
variety of perspectives, focusing on long-term interest rates
because they are less affected by cyclical factors. We have shown that there is indeed a very
close relationship, and that accounting for the trend components using
our proxies can help understand, model, and forecast long-term interest rates
and bond returns. Our results confirm the predictions of no-arbitrage
theory for the links between macroeconomic trends and the yield curve,
and demonstrate that these links are quantitatively important.

Our findings open up several avenues for future research. Most
importantly, they demonstrate that macro-finance models for the yield
curve need to allow for slow-moving changes in the long-run mean of
inflation and the real rate. This applies to both reduced-form
no-arbitrage models as well as to more structural, equilibrium models
of the yield curve. The purpose of specifying and estimating such
models is typically to understand bond risk premia/term premia and
risk compensation, and constructing the necessary long-run expectations without
accounting for shifts in macroeconomic trends is likely to give
misleading results for risk premia.

An additional dimension of the relationship of macroeconomic trends
and interest rates is that the relative
importance of these trend components changes over time. For example,
it is well known in empirical macroeconomics \citep[see, for example,][]{stock-watson-ucsv} that the
trend component of inflation was much more variable in the 70s and 80s
than in more recent decades. This raises the question how our (mostly
unconditional) results are affected by taking a conditional
perspective. Furthermore, this suggests that incorporating not only
macroeconomic trends but also stochastic volatility in these trend
components will be crucially important for macro-finance term
structure models.
