\section{Summary}
\label{sec-1}

The paper fits a state space model to survey expectations of
inflation, nominal rates, and output growth. The model features
shifting endpoints which are related through a long-run Fisher
equation. The data include surveys from various sources, and for a
number of different horizons. The model is able to fit these survey
expectations well. The paper then proceeds to calculate the term
premium in long-term interest rates by substracting the average
expected short rate implied by the model from observed yields. It
turns out that this term premium explains most of the variation in
interest rates, including the covariation of interest rates at
different maturities. The paper contains additional analysis of the
relationship between this estimated term premium and macro forecasts
as well as structural macroeconomic shocks.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec-2}

The paper addresses one of the central issues of the term structure
literature of the last several decades: What is the role of
expectations and risk premia for the evolution and dynamics of
long-term interest rates? The approach that the authors have chosen to
answer this question, however, appears to take a step backward from
the advances accomplished in this literature. Expectations are
taken exclusively from surveys without any information from yields,
and the links between expectations and asset prices that modern
finance theory requires for absence of arbitrage are completely
ignored. This stands in contrast to the promising and often successful
efforts taken in the no-arbitrage term structure literature to combine the information in
long-term yields with the information in surveys to understand the
expectations of investors. Instead, the model presented in the paper
is simply a slight extension of existing models, like those proposed by Kozicki and
Tinsley (2012) and Aruoba (2016), that are formulated to provide a smooth path of expectations from surveys that contain missing
observations and irregular horizons. In light of these points, the
methodological contribution of the paper is only modest.

What can we learn about macro-finance interactions and the term
structure of interest rates using this model? The key finding of the
paper is that the survey-based estimates of expectations actually
explain very little of the variation in long-term interest rates. The
authors interpret this finding as demonstrating the important role of
the term premium. While that is one possible interpretation, the other
way to phrase the result of the paper is that survey expectations are simply unsuccessful to
explain variation in asset prices. But that is a result that we have
known for a very long time, going all the way back to Shiller's results on excess
volatility from the 1970s and 1980s. Fundamentals, and expectations of
fundamentals, can only explain a small share of movements in asset
prices, and it is well-known that this is true for long-term interest
rates as well. The empirical results of the paper are perfectly in
line with this conventional wisdom. The term premium is a residual
from a model that does not do a good job explaining long-term yields,
hence this residual captures most of the variation in these
yields. All of the results in the paper are a reflection of this
simple fact. As an example, the term premium across maturities shows
strong comovement simply because there is pronounced comovements of yields across maturity. (As an
aside, this has very little to do with Cochrane-Piazzesi's results as
claimed by the authors, since Cochrane-Piazzesi documented the
surprising and controversial fact that the \emph{same} linear combination of yields predicts
bond returns for different maturities.)

For these reasons I think that the paper in its current shape and
form is making very little headway for the term structure
literature and macro-finance, both in terms of methodology and
empirical results. However, I still think the paper has potential, and
in the following I make some suggestions that I believe would improve
the paper:

\begin{itemize}
\item The contribution is to model survey expectations of macro variables
and yields, but there is essentially no model validation other than
some notion that the model fits the surveys well. I encourage the
authors to challenge the model more and demonstrate its
usefulness. One idea is to test the restrictions that are imposed by
the Fisher equation. Another is to use the model for forecasting the
macro variables and yields under consideration. There is a literature on the
role of survey expectations for yield forecasts (including, for
example, Van Dijk, Koopman van der Wel, and Wright, 2012; and
Altavilla, Giacomini, and Ragusa, 2014) and the present paper
may be able to make a contribution to this literature. Furthermore, the trends that
are extracted from the data may be compared to alternative estimates
of these trends, to assess their plausibility (e.g., the CBO's
estimate of potential GDP growth), i.e., to see whether the filtered
trends make economic sense.

\item Since the model-implied expectations don't explain much yield
variation, the subsequent results for the term premium are all
driven by the variation in yields. Therefore the results on
macro forecasts are as expected. And the impulse reponses would
presumably look the same if yields instead of the term premium was
used as the response variable. For this analysis to be convincing
the authors would have to argue that something is gained by first
subtracting survey expectations from yields before carrying out this
analysis. Currently it is hard to see what we learn from this. On
idea would be to run the same regressions for yields and for the
term premium (e.g., the impulse responses) and to assess whether this makes a difference.

\item The model could be used to provide some measures of uncertainty
around the estimated expectation paths (and estimated term
premia). Most readers would expect more discussion of disagreement
vs. subjective uncertainty, as well as estimation/parameter
uncertainty underlying the model. Currently the paper almost
exclusively provides point estimates of the objects of interests,
and essentially ignores uncertainty, while uncertainty is of course
absolutely central to forecasts about the future evolution of
macroeconomic and financial variables.

\item The paper estimates subjective risk premia, in contrast to objective
risk premia that would be obtained from statistical models of
expectations. Piazzesi, Salomao and Schneider (2015) provide an
in-depth comparison of these risk premia and provide an economic
explanation of the differences (they find the same result as the
present paper, that subjective risk premia are not very
volatile). This is just one example of papers in this literature
that contrast subjective and objective risk premia. All of this is
inherently connected to the question whether expectations are
rational. I
recommend that the authors put their findings into this perspective,
and consider bringing objective risk premia into the picture and
discussion.

\item The authors would be well-advised to argue more convincingly and
carefully justify why they ignore
yields in their estimation of the expectations component, in
contrast to a large body of work that has found ways to incorporate
both surveys and asset prices to accomplish this task. Examples of
yield-curve models that incorporate both yields and surveys, while
imposing absence of arbitrage, include Kim-Wright, Kim-Orphanides,
Chun (2011), Chernov and Mueller (2012), Kim and Priebsch (2013),
among others.
