\section{Introduction}

The level of the risk-free real rate of return that would prevail in
the absence of transitory disturbances has long been of interest to
researchers, policymakers, and financial investors.
However, recent structural changes in the global economy have brought
questions about the variation and influence of this equilibrium real rate
to the forefront \citep{clarida-new-neutral,yellen-pace}. Various
underlying fundamental economic forces,
such as lower productivity growth and an aging population, appear
to have slowly altered global saving and investment and, in turn,
pushed down the steady-state real interest rate. Accordingly, much
new research has examined potential changes in the level of the
equilibrium real short-term interest rate, which we denote
as $r^\ast_t$.\footnote{\label{fn:rstar} Discussions of the
  decline in $r^\ast$ include \cite{hhhw}, \cite{rachel-smith},
  \cite{laubach-williams}, \cite{johannsen-mertens}, \cite{kiley},
  \cite{lubik-mathes}, \cite{christensen-rudebusch-rstar}, and \cite{holston-laubach-williams} among
  many others. In the macroeconomics literature, $r^\ast_t$ is often
  labeled the neutral or natural rate of interest.} Remarkably, thus far, there has been very little work
addressing the effects of changes in $r^\ast_t$ on the dynamics of the
term structure of interest rates. We fill this gap and analyze how changes in the equilibrium real
rate will alter yield curves and bond risk pricing.

A useful illustration of the potential importance of accounting for
the equilibrium real rate is provided in Figure \ref{fig:data1}. The
secular decline in the 10-year Treasury yield since the early 1980s
reflects a gradual downtrend in the general level of U.S. interest
rates. Early on, a key driver of this decline was the reduction in the
long-run expected level of inflation, which is often referred to as
trend inflation and denoted as $\pi^\ast_t$. Figure \ref{fig:data1}
displays a measure of U.S. trend inflation based largely on long-horizon
inflation projections from a survey of professional forecasters
(details of this measure are described in the data section
below). While the link between trend inflation and interest rates has
been highlighted by some, e.g., \cite{cieslak-povala}, this macroeconomic trend clearly cannot
account for all of the decline in yields on its own. For the past two decades,
$\pi^\ast_t$ has stabilized close to 2 percent while longer-term
interest rates have continued to drift lower. Instead, much of the
recent downtrend in yields seems to reflect a lower equilibrium real
short-term interest rate, as is evident in the simple composite
measure of $r^\ast_t$ shown in Figure \ref{fig:data1} (details of this
measure are also described below). According to this measure, the
equilibrium real short rate remained little changed in a range between
2 and 3 percent from 1970 to around 2000 when it started to gradually
fall to below 1 percent currently. We argue that accounting for this
recent downtrend in $r^\ast_t$ as well as the earlier decline
in $\pi^\ast_t$---that is, an environment of falling stars---is critical for
understanding the dynamics of interest rates and for assessing bond
risk and expected returns.

Long-term nominal interest rates reflect expectations of future
inflation and real short rates---including their trend
components---subject to a risk adjustment. We first demonstrate the
theoretical significance of such longer-run components in an affine
no-arbitrage term structure model that allows for stochastic trends in
inflation and the real short rate---$\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$. The
model shows that $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$ act as level factors for
the nominal yield curve, as suggested by Figure \ref{fig:data1}. In
addition, the model describes how the cyclical components of inflation
and the real rate disproportionately influence the shorter end of the
yield curve and how a risk-premium factor affects long rates more than
short rates. Our model leads to testable implications about the
importance of both $r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$ for interest rates,
which we take to the data. Our empirical examination considers five
tests of whether the trends in inflation and the real rate are
quantitatively important for the determination of interest rates,
using common empirical proxies of these macroeconomic
trends.

As a first test, we document that time variation in both $\pi^\ast_t$
and $r^\ast_t$ is responsible for most of the persistence in
yields. While interest rates themselves are extremely persistent, the
difference between long-term interest rates and the equilibrium
nominal short rate, which is denoted
$i^\ast_t = \pi^\ast_t + r^\ast_t$, exhibits quick mean
reversion. Furthermore, regressions of long-term yields on the
macroeconomic trends recover the unit coefficients predicted by our
theoretical model. Our findings generalize the results of
\cite{cieslak-povala}, who regress nominal yields on a
proxy for trend inflation. While we confirm their finding that
$\pi^\ast_t$ is an important persistent component of interest rates,
we show that it is also crucial to include $r^\ast_t$ in order to
fully capture the trend component. Furthermore, after accounting for shifts in
$r_t^\ast$, we uncover strong evidence for a long-run Fisher effect,
which has found at best lukewarm support in previous studies that have
focused only on a bivariate relationship between yields and
inflation.\footnote{\label{fn:fisher}Prominent examples include
  \cite{mishkin92}, \cite{wallace-warner}, and \cite{evans-lewis}.}
Instead, from our broader perspective that allows for fluctuations in
the equilibrium real rate, we find that the trend components of
inflation and the real rate are related to interest rates exactly as
standard finance theory predicts.

Second, we show that accounting for both macroeconomic trends leads to substantial
improvements in interest rate forecast accuracy at medium and long forecast horizons
relative to the usual martingale forecasting benchmark. Our theoretical model
shows that such forecast improvements are a natural consequence
of the time series properties of inflation and the real short rate.
We document that, relative to the random walk alternative, the
improvements in forecast accuracy from including the trend
components are both economically and statistically significant.
In addition, as predicted by our model, to achieve these better forecasts,
it is crucial to incorporate $r^\ast_t$ in the shifting endpoint
of nominal interest rates---including only $\pi^\ast_t$ is insufficient.

Third, accounting for a time-varying $r^\ast_t$ is important
for understanding return predictability and estimating bond risk
premia. Recently, \cite{cieslak-povala} used the connection between trend inflation
and interest rates to decompose the nominal yield curve into risk
premiums and the expectations hypothesis (EH) component (i.e., a term
that equals the average short-term interest rate that investors expect
to prevail during the life of a bond). They present strong evidence
for the predictive power of the inflation trend for excess bond returns,
which suggests that incorporating the inflation trend is important to
understand the risk premium/EH decomposition. Since $r^\ast_t$ plays
the same role of a persistent level factor for nominal interest rates
as does $\pi^\ast_t$, our theoretical analysis then suggests that $r^\ast_t$,
like $\pi^\ast_t$, should have predictive power for bond returns. Hence, we
extend the results of \cite{cieslak-povala} by introducing shifts in the equilibrium
real interest rate into the prediction of risk premiums, and we find
substantial improvements from incorporating
$r^\ast_t$ in predicting excess bond returns.

Fourth, these bond return results suggest that measures of the bond
risk premium should account for movements in both $r^\ast_t$ and
$\pi^\ast_t$. Therefore, we provide an empirical decomposition of
long-term yields into expectations and term premium components that
takes into account the macroeconomic trends. We contrast our estimated
decomposition with a conventional one based on a stationary
vector-autoregression (VAR) of
yield-curve factors. The conventional decomposition implies an
implausibly stable expectations component and attributes most of the
secular decline in interest rates to the residual term premium, as
discussed in critiques by \cite{kim-orphanides} and \cite{brw2}.  Our
decomposition, which allows the mean of nominal yields to shift with
$i^\ast_t$, leads to a very different interpretation of the historical
evolution of long-term yields: the majority of their secular decline
is attributed to the decrease in $i^\ast_t$. Consequently, the term
premium, instead of exhibiting a dubious secular downtrend, behaves in
a predominantly cyclical fashion like other risk premia in asset
prices \citep{campbell-cochrane}.

As a final avenue of empirical examination, we compare the variance of
changes in the trend components of inflation and real rates to the
variance of interest rate changes at different
frequencies. \cite{duffee-inflation-risk} proposes using the ratio of
the variance of inflation news to the variance of innovations in
nominal interest rates as a useful metric to assess the importance of
inflation in the determination of interest rates. He documents that
for one-quarter innovations, this ratio is small for U.S.~Treasury
yields.  We generalize his measure to consider variance ratios for
longer $h$-period innovations, which allows us to compare the size of
unexpected changes, over, say, a span of five years, in inflation and
in nominal bond yields.  For one-quarter changes, we replicate the
small inflation variance ratio reported by Duffee. But in line with
our theoretical predictions, the inflation variance ratio increases
substantially with the horizon. We also generalize Duffee's measure to
incorporate fluctuations in $r^\ast_t$ and $i^\ast_t$. Although
confidence intervals are unavoidably wide, our estimates suggest that
during the postwar U.S.~sample, a large share of the interest rate
variability faced by investors over longer holding periods was due to
changes in the macroeconomic trend components of nominal yields.

Our results document the importance of macroeconomic trends in understanding the nominal
yield curve. Variations in both the inflation trend and the equilibrium real
interest rate are shown to be quantitatively important, and while the
former has been increasingly recognized in yield curve analysis, a
time-varying $r^\ast_t$ has been essentially ignored---a substantial
oversight in the literature. Our empirical evidence linking inflation
and real rate trends to the yield curve and risk pricing has
far-reaching implications for modeling of interest rates and bond risk
premia. In order to accurately capture interest rate dynamics, both
structural and reduced-form models of the yield curve should allow for
slow-moving trend components. The common approach of specifying a
stationary system for the term structure of interest rates with
constant means for the risk factors is problematic, because it
counterfactually rules out any structural, long-run changes of
economic variables and asset prices. Accounting for such long-run
changes, i.e., for shifting trends, is crucial for researchers and
practitioners assessing the term premium in long-term interest rates,
forecasting bond yields and returns, and understanding the drivers and
historical evolution of the term structure of interest rates.

Our paper relates to several strands of literature. A large literature
documents the importance of a trend component in the inflation rate,
notably \cite{kozicki-tinsley}, \cite{stock-watson-ucsv},
\cite{faust-wright}, and \cite{clark-doh}. The persistence in the real
interest rate is considered early on by \cite{rose} and was surveyed
by \cite{neely-rapach}. A related literature investigates
the long-run Fisher effect (see the references in footnote
\ref{fn:fisher}). Much recent literature uses macroeconomic models and data to
estimate the equilibrium real interest rate and to understand its
structural drivers (see the references in footnote
\ref{fn:rstar}). Our paper sheds a new light on these related strands
of literature by showing that the apparent trends in inflation and
real interest rates are not only consistent with the observed behavior
of the yield curve, but are in fact critially important to understanding
that behavior. Within the macro-finance literature on the term
structure of interest rates, some models have been proposed that allow
for changes in trend inflation; see \cite{htv}, \cite{rudebuschwu},
and \cite{bcm}. However these models, like essentially all equilibrium
models \citep[including][]{wachter,bansal-shaliastovich} and reduced-form
no-arbitrage models \citep[such as][]{chernov-mueller,jps} of the term
structure of interest rates, generally assume a constant equilibrium
real rate, in contrast to the findings of the literature cited
above.\footnote{The only exceptions we are aware of are \cite{abw},
  who allow regime switching in the mean of the real short rate, and
  the macro-finance models of Hans Dewachter and co-authors,
  including \cite{dewachter-lyrio} where $r^\ast_t$ is
  deterministically linked to $\pi^\ast_t$ and \cite{dewachter-iania}
  where $r^\ast_t$ is tied to trend output growth.}
Finally, we contribute to the literature on interest rate
forecasting. The work in this area most closely related to ours is
\cite{dijk-etal}, who documented improvements in forecast relative to a
random walk by including shifting endpoints that were linked to proxies for trend
inflation. We demonstrate that substantial further gains are possible
by forecasting that interest rates gradually revert to the endpoint
$i^\ast_t$ which includes the equilibrium real rate

The paper is structured as follows: Section \ref{sec:theory} shows the
theoretical implications of the presence of trends in inflation and
the real rate for long-term interest rates. Section \ref{sec:data}
describes our empirical proxies for $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$. In
Section \ref{sec:persistence}, we investigate sources for the
persistence of interest rates.  Section \ref{sec:returns} documents
the evidence for the incremental predictive power of $\pi^\ast_t$ and
$r^\ast_t$ for future excess bond returns. In Section
\ref{sec:forecasting}, we show substantial improvements in forecast
accuracy are possible after accounting for macroeconomic trends in
interest rates. In Section \ref{sec:tp}, we present a novel estimate
of the term premium in long-term interest rates that accounts for
shifting endpoints. Section \ref{sec:horizons} provides new variance
ratios for assessing the importance of the inflation and real-rate
trends for interest rate changes at different frequencies. Section
\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes.

\section{Some theory: macro trends and yields}
\label{sec:theory}

A variety of macro-finance models, assuming absence of arbitrage, imply that expectations of future macroeconomic
variables are linked to long-term interest rates (e.g., *** Ang-Piazzesi 2003 and Rudebusch and Wu 2008). Specifically, the
yield on a long-term bond is driven by expectations of future
inflation and expectations of future real rates, plus a
risk premium that depends on the specific asset-pricing model. Early models invariably ignore the trend
components of inflation and the real interest rate, and here, we discuss the 
discuss the implications for the yield curve of such components.

%% inflation
According to the prevailing consensus in empirical
macroeconomics---prominently exemplified by \cite{stock-watson-ucsv}
and recently surveyed in \cite{faust-wright}---inflation is best
modeled as an $I(1)$ process if one aims to produce competitive
forecasts or accurately capture the evolution of expectations. Hence,
a Beveridge-Nelson trend can be defined as
\[ \pi^\ast_t = \underset{h \rightarrow \infty}{\lim} E_t \pi_{t+h},\]
assuming that inflation does not have a deterministic
trend. From a macroeconomic perspective, this time-varying inflation
endpoint can be viewed as the perceived inflation target of the
central bank. Inflation can thus be modeled as the sum of a (random
walk) trend component and a (stationary) cycle component. To illustrate the role
of trend and cycle we use the following simple parametric specification:
\begin{equation}
\pi_{t+1} = \pi^\ast_t + c_t + e_{t+1}, \quad \pi^\ast_t =
\pi^\ast_{t-1} + \xi_t, \quad c_t = \phi_c c_{t-1} + u_t, \label{eq:inflation}
\end{equation}
where the innovations $\xi_t$ and $u_t$ and the noise component $e_t$
are all \emph{iid}. This specification, which is similar to the one in
\cite{duffee-inflation-risk}, is chosen for convenience and with the goal
of yielding both simple expressions for expectations and simple bond
pricing equations in an illustrative no-arbitrage term structure
model.\footnote{Note that in this specification, the Beveridge-Nelson
  cycle includes both an AR(1) process ($c_t$) and measurement error
  ($e_{t+1}$). Equation \eqref{eq:inflation} assumes that the shocks
  $\xi_t$ and $u_t$ affect only expectations of future inflation but
  not current inflation, which slightly simplifies the bond pricing
  formulas but has no fundamental significance.}  Expectations at $t$
about future inflation from $t+h$ to $t+h+1$ are given as
$E_t \pi_{t+h+1} = \pi^\ast_t + \phi_c^h c_t$.

%% real rate
Regarding the real interest rate, there are also compelling reasons to
allow for the presence of a time-varying trend component. Structural
economic changes, such as changes in the trend rates of productivity
and population growth, may affect the equilibrium real rate. An
intense debate has developed in academic and policy circles about
whether the natural or equilibrium real interest rate has shifted down
since the Financial Crisis---see, among many others,
\cite{summers-2014}, \cite{del-negro-rstar},
\cite{holston-laubach-williams}. To assess the effects of such changes
on the term structure of interest rates, we also assume that
the one-period real rate, $r_t$, is $I(1)$. We define the equilibrium
real rate as the Beveridge-Nelson trend,
\[ r_t^\ast = \underset{h \rightarrow \infty}{\lim} E_t r_{t+h},\]
which can be understood as the real rate that prevails in the economy
after all shocks have died out. We discuss in Section \ref{sec:data}
how this definition relates to other empirical and theoretical
concepts of what has come to be called ``r-star'' in the
literature. Again a simple parametric specification can best
illustrate the implications of the presence of a trend in the real rate:
\begin{equation}
r_t = r^\ast_t + g_t, \quad r^\ast_t = r^\ast_{t-1} + \eta_t, \quad
g_t = \phi_g g_{t-1} + v_t,\label{eq:realrate}
\end{equation}
where the cyclical real-rate gap, $g_t$, captures among other factors variation in the
real short rate due to monetary policy \citep{neiss-nelson}.

The assumption of unit roots in inflation and the real rate is merely
a convenient way to model these very persistent processes.  It
simplifies the exposition of our model and the arguments regarding
trend components, but it is not crucial.  Taken literally, a unit root
specification is implausible because the forecast error variances of
inflation and real rates do not in fact increase linearly with the
forecast horizon as predicted by a unit root. Instead, both variables
have always remained within certain bounds.  However, in finite
samples, a stationary process can always be approximated arbitrarily
well by a unit root process, and it is well-known that doing so can
often be beneficial for forecasting \citep[e.g.,][]{campbell-perron}.
Therefore the unit root assumption is false if taken literally but
nevertheless very useful (like all models, according to the famous
dictum by George Box). The trend components $\pi^\ast_t$ and
$r^\ast_t$ can be viewed as highly persistent components of
$\pi_t$ and $r_t$ that capture expectations at the long horizons
relevant for investors, even if infinite-horizon expectations are
constant. In practice, these relevant time horizons are often in the
5- to 10-year range when cyclical shocks have largely dissipated, as
noted by \cite{laubach-williams} and \cite{summers-2015}.

Under the simple parameterization given in equations
\eqref{eq:inflation} and \eqref{eq:realrate}, and assuming absence of
arbitrage, we have the following decomposition for the
continuously-compounded nominal yield on
a risk-free (government) zero-coupon bond with an $n$-period maturity:
\begin{equation}
y_t^{(n)} =  \underbrace{\pi_t^\ast + \frac{1-\phi_c^n}{n(1-\phi_c)}
    c_t}_{\sum_{i=1}^n E_t \pi_{t+i}/n} +
    \underbrace{r_t^\ast + \frac{1-\phi_g^n}{n(1-\phi_g)}
    g_t}_{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} E_t r_{t+i}/n}  + \text{ }  CONV^{(n)} + YTP_t^{(n)},\label{eq:yields}
\end{equation}
where $CONV^{(n)}$ stands for maturity-specific bond convexity (due to
Jensen-inequality terms) and $YTP_t^{(n)}$ is the yield term premium,
which in theory captures compensation for duration risk in long-term
bonds and the effects of frictions, and in practice is a residual
containing all factors other than the expectations component. Appendix
\ref{app:dtsm} presents a simple affine term structure model that adds
to equations \eqref{eq:inflation} and \eqref{eq:realrate} a
specification for the stochastic discount factor and the prices of
risk, which provides interested readers with more details, including a
specification for the term premium. Most of the key points, however,
can be seen without reference to a fully specified model.

The main observation is that because nominal yields reflect
expectations of future inflation and real rates, they necessarily
share the same trend components. Yields of all maturities contain the
trend component $i^\ast_t = \pi^\ast_t + r^\ast_t$, the endpoint for
the nominal short rate.\footnote{This shifting endpoint $i^\ast_t$ is
  the trend component of $i_t = E_t(\pi_{t+1}) + r_t$. In a no-arbitrage model,
  the nominal short rate in addition to $i_t$ also contains a Jensen inequality
  term and an inflation risk premium, but both are negligibly small.}
As all yields load equally on $i^\ast_t$ it serves the role of a
level factor for the yield curve.  Due to the presence of stochastic
trends in inflation and the real rate yields are also $I(1)$, whereas
detrended yields, $y^{(n)}_t - i^\ast_t$, are
$I(0)$. These detrended yields, or ``interest rate cycles'' in the
parlance of \cite{cieslak-povala}, will play an important role in the
empirical analysis below.

The cyclical components $c_t$ and $g_t$ are slope factors as they affect
short-term yields more strongly than long-term yields. That the loadings of
yields on these factors decline to zero with increasing maturity is
particularly easy to see in equation \eqref{eq:yields} because $g_t$
and $c_t$ follow AR(1) processes, but it is true more generally for
stationary yield-curve factors. Since the cycles play a smaller role
for long-term yields, we will focus most of our empirical analysis
on long-term yields and forward rates, to most clearly see the link
between macro trends and the yield curve.

Equation \eqref{eq:yields} can be viewed as an extended Fisher
equation for long-term interest rates. It suggests that loadings on
inflation expectations are unity for all maturities, and hence that
there is long-run Fisher effect, i.e., that inflation and yields share
the same long-run trend. But we have so far focused only on the
expectations component of long-term yields, and said little about
risk-adjustment and the term premium. Yields are driven by
expectations of future short rates under an adjusted, risk-neutral
probability measure, and the term premium in \eqref{eq:yields}
captures this adjustment. If $pi^\ast_t$ directly affected the prices
of risk, then $YTP_t^{(n)}$ would systematically vary with changes in
$\pi^\ast_t$. In this case, the loadings of long-term yields on
$\pi^\ast_t$ would not necessarily be unity.\footnote{Technically
  speaking, we assumed that inflation has a unit root under the
  real-world probability measure, but this does not necessarily imply
  that it also has a unit root under the risk-neutral measure. In the
  model in Appendix \ref{app:dtsm} we additionally assume that the
  term premium is not systematically affected by macro trends, so that
  inflation and the real rate consequently also have a unit root under
  the risk-neutral measure, and yields have unit loadings on macro
  trends.}  The same reasoning of course holds for $r^\ast_t$. In
other words, there is a clear theoretical prediction about the
connection between macro trends and yields through the expectations
component, but this could be altered or even partially undone by the
term premium. However, we will present evidence that macro trends
indeed appear to affect long-term yields one-for-one, suggesting that
the any possible links between macro trends and the term premium are
not strong enough to appreciably alter the role for macro trends in
the yield curve.

While standard theory predicts that the persistent components in 
inflation and the real interest rate will be
reflected in long-term interest rates, the key open question that we 
consider is whether this link between macro trends and
the yield curve matters empirically. How important was
variation in $i^\ast_t$ for the Treasury yield curve? We will
demonstrate that accounting for changes in $i^\ast_t$ substantially
alters our interpretation of yield curve movements and our
understanding of bond risk premia.

\section{Data and trend estimates}
\label{sec:data}

We now describe the data and the estimates of the macroeconomic trends
that we will use in testing the model's predictions.  Our data set is
quarterly and extends from 1971:Q4 to 2017:Q2. The interest rate data
are end-of-quarter zero-coupon Treasury yields from \cite{gsw} with
maturities from one to 15 years. We augment these data with three- and
six-month Treasury bill rates from the Federal Reserve's H.15 data. In
our empirical analysis, we mainly focus on long-term (five-year and ten-year)
yields as well as long-term (five-to-ten-year) forward rates to
exhibit the importance of $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$, and these are
the relevant horizons for our trend measures as well.

For measuring the macroeconomic trends we take existing estimates from
the macroeconomics literature. Our goal is to assess whether such
off-the-shelf measures can provide evidence linking the inflation and
real rate trends to the yield curve and risk pricing. An alternative
strategy would be to estimate time-varying $r^\ast_t$ and
$\pi^\ast_t$, for example within a no-arbitrage term structure
model. We prefer our approach, which conditions on existing estimates,
for two main reasons. First, we view our approach as more
conservative, because our macro trend estimates have not been
fine-tuned to incorporate no-arbitrage restrictions or information in
long-term yields. It would be much easier 
to demonstrate a link between long-term yields and macro trends using
trends that were estimated with long-term yields. Therefore, we do not
include such trend estimates, for example, the estimates of $\pi^\ast_t$ by
\cite{clr} or estimates of $r^\ast_t$ by \cite{johannsen-mertens},
\cite{christensen-rudebusch-rstar}, or \cite{del-negro-rstar}. All of our
empirical trend proxies are based only on information in macroeconomic
variables, short-term interest rates, and surveys. In this way, they avoid
any circularity and can provide
the strongest evidence of identifying empirical links between macro trends and
the yield curve. Second, the estimation of macro trends, in particular
of $r^\ast_t$, requires many difficult modeling decisions and, in the
case of Bayesian estimation, the choice of priors, all of which have
important effects on the properties of the estimated trend
series.\footnote{For example, \cite{laubach-williams} openly admit the
  estimation and specification uncertainty underlying their estimate
  of $r^\ast_t$.}  We prefer to instead use widely-used existing
measures of the macro trends and focus on how
these trends relate to the yield curve.

Empirical proxies for trend inflation, $\pi^\ast_t$,
have been often constructed from surveys, statistical
models, or a combination of the two---see, for example,
\cite{stock-watson-core} and the references therein. We
employ a well-known survey-based measure, namely, the Federal Reserve's
series on the \underline{p}erceived inflation \underline{t}arget
\underline{r}ate, denoted PTR. It
measures long-run expectations of inflation in the price index of
personal consumption expenditure (PCE), and is widely used in empirical
work---see, for example, \cite{clark-mccracken}. PTR is based
exclusively on survey expectations since 1979 (i.e., for most of
our sample).\footnote{Since 1979, PTR corresponds to long-run inflation
  expectations from the Survey of Professional Forecasters. Before 1979,
  PTR is based on estimates from the learning model for expected
  inflation of \cite{kozicki-tinsley}. For details on the construction of PTR, see
  \cite{brayton-tinsley}. PTR can be downloaded with the updates of
  the Federal Reserve's FRB/US large-scale macroeconomic model at
  \url{https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/frbus/us-models-package.htm}.}
Figure \ref{fig:data1} shows that from the beginning of our sample to
the late 1990s, this estimate mostly mirrored the increase and
decrease in the ten-year yield. Since then, however, it has been
essentially flat at two percent, which is the level of the longer-run
inflation goal of the Federal Reserve that was first publicly
designated in 2012. Other survey
expectations of inflation over the longer run, such as the long-range
forecasts in the Blue Chip survey, exhibit a similar pattern.\footnote{The inflation trend
that \cite{cieslak-povala} use is a simple weighted moving average of past core inflation, which,
as they note, co-moves closely with PTR.}

The recent literature on modeling and estimation of the natural,
neutral, or equilibrium real interest rate---commonly referred to as
$r^\ast$---has grown rapidly. Importantly, there are various closely related 
definitions and concepts of $r^\ast$. Since we require estimates that
are consistent with our definition of the equilibrium real rate, it is
useful to briefly review these concepts here. In dynamic stochastic
general equilibrium models \citep[e.g.][]{curdia-etal}, the natural or
efficient real rate is the real rate that would prevail in the absence
of nominal frictions. This is generally a stationary variable and
corresponds to a short-run concept. By contrast, our definition of
$r^\ast$ as the (Beveridge-Nelson) long-run trend component of the
real interest rate is a long-run concept. It coincides with the
definition used in \cite{lubik-mathes} who estimate $r^\ast_t$ as the
time-varying mean of the real rate in a time-varying parameter VAR
model.\footnote{Other estimates of $r^\ast_t$ based on this long-run
  concept include \cite{johannsen-mertens} and the common-trends VARs in \cite{del-negro-rstar} and
  \cite{cem}.}  Another concept
of the natural rate, used by \cite{laubach-williams} and \cite{kiley},
among others, is the real rate at which monetary policy is neither
expansionary nor contractionary. In these models the unobserved
natural rate is inferred from macroeconomic data using a simple
structural specification and the Kalman filter---Laubach and Williams
work with a standard IS curve whereas Kiley augments the IS curve with
financial conditions. Their natural rate is a medium-run concept in
the sense that it is the level that the real policy rate would revert
back to after having responded to economic shocks, but this neutral
policy stance could change over time.%\footnote{For example, Yellen
  %(TBC: citation) has argued that the neutral rate was expected to
  %rise over the long run, as headwinds from the aftermath of the
  %financial crisis subside.}  
However, in the models of
\cite{laubach-williams} and \cite{kiley}, the natural rate is
specified as a random walk, so that their $r^\ast_t$ is in fact
consistent with our definition as a long-run trend. We will therefore
use the three model-based estimates of \cite{laubach-williams},
\cite{kiley} and \cite{lubik-mathes} in our
analysis.\footnote{Alternative survey-based estimates of $r_t^\ast$
  would require long-run expectations of both nominal interest rates
  and inflation. Unfortunately, the available time span for the former
  is quite limited (the earliest is a biannual Blue Chip Financial
  Forecasts series that starts in 1986) and they have also been found
  to be less accurate than forecasts of inflation \citep[see, for
  example,][]{dijk-etal}.}

Figure \ref{fig:data2} plots these three macro estimates of
$r^\ast_t$, and it shows that since the early 1980s, all three have
evolved in a broadly similar fashion. A straightforward method to
aggregate and smooth the information from these three specific
modeling strategies is to take their average.  In the 1970s, 80s, and
90s, this average fluctuated modestly between 2 and 3 percent, which
is consistent with the common view of that era that the
equilibrium real rate was effectively constant. However, from 2000 to
2017, all of the measures fell, with an average decline of 2.2
percentage points. The equilibrium real rate was likely pushed lower by 
global structural changes that included
slowdowns in trend growth in various countries, increases in desired
saving due to global demographic forces and strong precautionary
saving flows from emerging market economies, changing demographics, as well as declines in
desired investment spending partly reflecting a fall in the relative
price of capital goods \citep{summers-2015, rachel-smith, carvalho-et-al}. A pronounced
decline in $r^\ast_t$ occurred in 2008 during the Financial Crisis, and this 
decline was followed by almost a decade
of sustained low levels of $r^\ast_t$, a finding that is common across
different models beyond the ones shown here.

Ideally, our trend estimates should reflect information that was
available contemporaneously to investors. Having a reasonable
alignment of $r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$ to the real-time evolution of
investors' information sets is particularly relevant for properly
assessing the value of macro trends in predicting future yields and
bond returns and determining the term premium in long-term yields (as
in Sections \ref{sec:forecasting}--\ref{sec:tp}). Since 1979, our
survey-based estimate of $\pi^\ast_t$ has been available to bond
investors at the end of each quarter, when our yields are
sampled. Real-time concerns have been more acute for estimates of
$r^\ast_t$ \citep{clark-kozicki}.  To construct $r^\ast_t$, we use
filtered (i.e, one-sided) estimates of the equilibrium real rate from the
three macroeconomic models cited above. That is, these estimates only use data
up to quarter $t$ to infer the unobserved value of $r^\ast_t$. While
the estimated model parameters are based on the full sample of final
revised data, \cite{laubach-williams-redux} show that truly real-time
estimation of their model delivers an estimated series of $r^\ast_t$
that is close to their final revised estimate over the period that
both are available. This suggests that an alternative real-time
estimation with real-time empirical trend proxies would likely yield
similar results.

Intuitively, our empirical measures of $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$---and
the resulting estimate of $i^\ast_t$---are consistent with a
compelling narrative about the evolution of long-term nominal interest
rates, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:data1}. Starting with the Volcker
disinflation of the 1980s, interest rates and inflation trended down
together. Around the turn of the millennium, long-run inflation
expectations stabilized near 2 percent. However, $i^\ast_t$ and
long-term interest rates continued to decline in part because
structural changes in the global economy started pushing down c the
equilibrium real rate. The
following analysis investigates whether the link between macro trends
and the yield curve that underlies this narrative is supported by the
empirical evidence, and whether accounting for shifts in $i^\ast_t$
alters our interpretation of interest rate movements and bond risk
premia.

\section{Persistence, unit roots, and cointegration}
\label{sec:persistence}

If the trend components of inflation and the real interest rate play
an important role in driving movements in the yield curve, then these
macro trends should account for most of the persistence of long-term
interest rates. The theoretical discussion in Section \ref{sec:theory}
shows that $i^\ast_t$ is a component of bond yields under quite
general assumptions, and now we investigate empirically how important
this component is for the dynamic properties of yields. A related
question is whether changes $r^\ast_t$ materially contribute to
movements in $i^\ast_t$ and persistence in bond yields, or whether
accounting for movements in $\pi^\ast_t$ alone is sufficient. We focus
our analysis on the five- and ten-year yields and the
five-to-ten-year forward rate as long-term rates give us the
cleanest picture of the role of trends for reasons described in
Section \ref{sec:theory}.

The key issue can easily be seen visually by considering raw and
detrended interest rate series. Figure \ref{fig:cycles} shows the
ten-year yield, the difference between this yield and $\pi^\ast_t$,
and the difference between the yield and $i^\ast_t$, where in the
first two cases the series is demeaned to ease the visual
comparison. The yield itself exhibits a clearly trending
behavior. Subtracting out $\pi^\ast_t$ gives a series that has a less
pronounced but still clearly visible downward trend, evident in the
substantial decline of about four percentage points from the level
prevailing in the 1990s to the end of the sample. Only if we \emph{also}
subtract $r^\ast_t$, do we obtain a series that is not obviously
trending and has clear mean reversion, i.e., a proper interest rate
cycle. The following statistical analysis demonstrates that the
persistence in long-term rates is very pronounced, that subtracting
$i^\ast_t$ purges most of this persistence, and that the blue line in
in Figure \ref{fig:cycles}, $y^{(10y)}_t - i^\ast_t$, is indeed a
reasonable measure of the cycle component in long-term bond yields.

Table \ref{tab:persistence} documents the persistence of long-term rates and the
macro trends. It reports the standard
deviation and two measures of persistence: the estimated first-order
autocorrelation coefficient, $\hat{\rho}$, and the half-life, which
indicates the number of quarters until half of a given shock has died
out and is calculated as $\ln(0.5)/\ln(\hat{\rho})$. The persistence
of the interest rates is very high, with first-order autocorrelation
coefficient of 0.97 and a half-life between 21 and 25 quarters. The
macro trends and $i^\ast_t$ are even more persistent: Our equilibrium
real-rate series has an autocorrelation coefficient of 0.98 and a
half-life of about 30 quarters, and the inflation trend and $i^\ast_t$
have autocorrelation coefficients of 0.99 and half-lives of 86 and 67
quarters, respectively. We also examine the persistence properties of
these series by testing the null hypothesis of a unit autoregressive
root, and report the following test-statistics in Table
\ref{tab:persistence}: the parametric Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)
$t$-statistic, the non-parametric Phillips-Perron (PP) $Z_\alpha$
statistic, and the efficient DF-GLS test statistic of
Elliott-Rothenberg-Stock (ERS).\footnote{For the ADF test, we include
  a constant and $k$ lagged difference in the test regression, where
  $k$ is determined using the general-to-specific procedure suggested
  by \cite{ng-perron-95}. We start with $k=4$ quarterly lags and
  reduce the number of lags until the coefficient on the last lag is
  significant at the ten percent level. For the PP test, we use a
  Newey-West estimator of the long-run variance with four lags.  When
  the series under consideration is a residual from an estimated
  cointegration regression, we don't include intercepts in the ADF or
  PP regression equations and use the critical values provided by
  \cite{phillips-ouliaris}, which depend on the number of regressors
  in the cointegration equation. For the ERS test we use four lags.}
All three tests agree that we cannot reject a unit root in these
series. In addition, the low-frequency stationarity test of
\cite{mueller-watson}, for which the $p$-values are reported in the last column
of Table \ref{tab:persistence}, strongly rejects
stationarity for each series. In sum, long-term yields and macro
trends are highly persistent and can be effectively modeled as $I(1)$
processes.

In light of this evidence, the question naturally arises whether this
persistence is driven by the same underlying trend, that is, whether
there is a cointegration relationship between long-term rates and the
macro trend estimates. A first test considers the cointegration rank 
$r$ of $Y_t = (y_t, \pi^\ast_t, r^\ast_t)'$, where $y_t$ is either the five-
or ten-year yield or the five-to-ten-year forward rate. Table
\ref{tab:coint} reports the results of the \cite{johansen-1991} trace test for the
cointegration rank $r$.\footnote{The
  test uses two lags of $Y_t$ in the VAR representation, based on
  information criteria.}  For all three rates, the hypothesis $r=0$ (no
cointegration) is strongly rejected against the alternative $r>0$. The
hypothesis that $r=1$, however, is accepted. These
results strongly suggest that there is exactly one cointegration
vector among any long-term rate, the inflation trend and the
equilibrium real rate.

We next turn to the nature of the relationship between the macro
trends and long-term rates, including the individual roles of
$\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$ as well as inference about the
cointegration vector $\beta$. A natural
starting point is a simple regression of yields on the trend
components.\footnote{Much empirical work, for example, \cite{kpsw},
  has documented the substantial persistence in nominal interest
  rates, inflation, and real interest rates. The main difference
  between our static regressions and the usual cointegration
  regressions in this context \citep[as in][for example]{rose} is that
  we use directly observable proxies for the trend components of
  $\pi_t$ and $r_t$. } Table \ref{tab:reg} reports the results for
such regressions with the three long-term rates as dependent
variable. In each case, we estimate two versions of the regressions
(with standard errors calculated using the Newey-West estimator with
six lags). The first version has only a constant and $\pi^\ast_t$ as
regressors, which is the same regression that \cite{cieslak-povala}
estimated using their simple moving-average estimate of the inflation
trend (see their table 1). These regression results show high $R^2$'s
at all maturities and $\pi^\ast_t$ coefficients that are just above
one and highly significant.\footnote{Our estimated coefficients on
  $\pi^\ast_t$ are somewhat higher than in \cite{cieslak-povala}
  because our measure of the inflation trend is less variable, though
  when $r^\ast_t$ is added, the estimated coefficients for
  $\pi^\ast_t$ decrease toward one.} \cite{cieslak-povala} interpret
these results as indicating that trend inflation drives the level of
yield curve. However, the results for the second regression
specification show that incorporating the real rate trend is also
important. Indeed, with the addition of $r^\ast_t$ to the regressions,
both the inflation and real rate trends coefficients are highly
significant, and the regression $R^2$'s increase a further 7 to 12
percentage points.

Taken at face value, these estimates suggest that changes in
$r^\ast_t$ along with fluctuations in $\pi^\ast_t$, are key sources of
variation in long-term interest rates.  The interpretation of these
results is complicated by the fact that all of the variables in the
regressions are very persistent and behave like $I(1)$ variables, as
shown in Table \ref{tab:persistence}. If the variables are also
cointegrated, as the evidence in Table \ref{tab:coint} strongly
suggests, it is well-known \citep[e.g.,][Chapter 19]{hamilton} that
these linear regressions provide (superconsistent) estimates of
$\beta$ and the $R^2$ converges to one. However, conventional
hypothesis tests about the coefficients, such as the Newey-West
standard errors we report, are valid only under additional assumptions
about the dynamic interactions among the variables. Reliable inference
can be obtained using ``Dynamic OLS'' where leads and lags of
first-differences of the regressors are included in the regressions,
or using the reduced-rank VAR estimation of \cite{johansen-1991}. Both 
analyses lead to the same 
conclusions about $\beta$ as Table \ref{tab:reg}, though we omit details
here for brevity.

All in all, the results suggest that the cointegrating coefficients on both
$\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$ are close to oneor slightly higher. 
One important question is whether $\beta$ can be approximated by $(1, -1, -1)$, which
is an intuitively appealing choice that simplifies the detrending of interest rates. 
The unit coefficients in the cointegration vector is also supported by the theory in
Section \ref{sec:theory}, which predicted that yields are affected
one-for-one by changes in $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$ unless the macro trends
interact with the term premium in such a way as to substantially alter
the effects through expectations.  For the long-term forward
rate, we can't reject the null that $\beta = (1, -1, -1)$, suggesting
that $f^{(5y,10y)}_t - \pi^\ast_t - r^\ast_t$ is not stochastically
trending, i.e., stationary. For the ten-year yield, and particularly
for the five-year yield, there is some evidence that the coefficients
on macro trends are above one, but only slightly so. We will show
below that using $\beta = (1, -1, -1)$ works very well in practice for
detrending even the five-year and ten-year yields. Importantly, the
cointegration relationship involves both macro trends, which in turn
implies that a regression of long-term rates on $\pi^\ast_t$ alone is
misspecified and detrending long-term rates by only $\pi^\ast_t$ is
insufficient.

How much persistent variation in long-term rates is captured by our
measures of $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$? To address this question we
examine the time series properties of detrended long-term interest
rates with one or both of the trend components subtracted out, which
are reported in Table \ref{tab:persistence}. We consider four
different ways of detrending interest rates: subtracting out either
$\pi^\ast_t$ or $i^\ast_t$ or using the residuals from each of the two
regressions in Table \ref{tab:reg}.  Several findings stand out:
First, detrending with $r^\ast_t$ as well as $\pi^\ast_t$ removes
substantially more persistence, typically reducing the half-life by
about 40-50\%. That is, $\pi^\ast_t$ is not the only important driver
of interest rate persistence. Second, the detrended series are
substantially less variable and less persistent than the original
interest rate series. For example, shocks to the ten-year yield have a
half-life of about 5-1/2 years, whereas shocks to the difference
between the ten-year yield and $i^\ast_t$ have a half-life of just
under one year. Clearly, a very substantial share of the persistence
in interest rates is accounted for by $i^\ast_t$. Finally, although
detrending by calculating residuals generally leads to series that are
less persistent than those that are simple differences, if we detrend
with both macro trends than the simple differences do almost as
well. In particular for the forward rate the two series
have very similar properties, because the regression coefficients are
already quite close to one. Even detrending with simple
differences, i.e., using the cointegrating residual for $\beta = (1,
-1, -1)'$, accounts for a large share of the persistence in interest
rates, as long as we use $i^\ast_t$ and not only $\pi^\ast_t$.

Unit root tests provide further evidence supporting detrending with
both $r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$.  These tests show strong evidence
against the unit root null for the series that are detrended with both
$\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$. By contrast, the unit root null is never
rejected at the five percent level for the original interest rate series
or for series that are detrended with just $\pi^\ast_t$. When
detrending with both $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$, the ADF and PP
tests, as well as the ERS test in the case of the forward rate, find
equally strong or even stronger evidence against a unit root for the
simple differences as for the residuals. For the five- and ten-year
yields, the ERS test rejects more strongly for the residuals than for
the simple differences, but it still rejects the unit root at the
ten-percent level for simple differences. Finally, the LFST test
supports the view that $y_t - i^\ast_t$ is stationary for the ten-year
yield and the forward rate, and for the five-year yield, it only
marginally rejects this hypothesis.

These results have implications for the debate about the long-run
Fisher effect, which posits a common trend for inflation and interest
rates with a unit coefficient (leaving aside tax considerations). A
sizeable literature has tested this hypothesis with mixed results,
often estimating an inflation coefficient that is significantly larger
than one (see the references in footnote \ref{fn:fisher}). Our
evidence indicates that the series $y_t - \pi^\ast_t - r^\ast_t$ is
stationary, which provides support for a long-run Fisher effect if
shifts in the equilibrium real rate are taken into account.  The
importance of time variation in $r^\ast_t$ can explain why past
research has generally been unable to find a stable relationship
between nominal interest rates and inflation, going back to
\cite{rose} and recently summarized by \cite{neely-rapach}. If yields
are regressed only on inflation or an estimate of the inflation trend
like our $\pi^\ast_t$, the regression is misspecified as the residual
contains the omitted trend $r^\ast_t$. Table \ref{tab:reg} shows that
the coefficients on $\pi^\ast_t$ are substantially larger in such
regressions as when $r^\ast_t$ is included, which may explain why it
has been difficult to uncover the Fisher effect.

A final question in this context is whether and how quickly yields
respond to shifts in the trends. To answer this, we estimate a standard
error-correction equation for each of the long-term rate series, using
$\beta = (1, -1, -1)$. First-differenced rates, $\Delta y_t$ are
regressed on the error-correction term
$(y_{t-1} - \pi^\ast_{t-1} - r^\ast_{t-1})$, an intercept, and four
lags of $\Delta y_t$, $\Delta \pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$. Table
\ref{tab:ecm} shows that the error-correction coefficient is estimated
to be significantly negative, indicating that when long-term are high
relative to $i^\ast_t$ they subsequently fall back toward this
trend. That is, yields exhibit strong equilibrium correction. As
before, the result is particularly strong for the forward rate, which
has a highly significant coefficient of -0.22, suggesting that on the
margin a percentage point deviation from the trend is followed by a 22
basis point reversal to the trend within one quarter. A Wald test
shows strong evidence against the hypothesis that the macro trends do
not Granger-cause interest rates. This evidence further supports the
view that interest rates should be jointly modeled with their
underlying macro trends, in particular when it comes to forecasting
their future evolution.

\section{Predicting excess bond returns}
\label{sec:returns}

The theoretical discussion and evidence above suggests that knowledge
of the macroeconomic trends underlying yields---and in particular of
the current level of yields \emph{relative to the their trend}
$i^\ast_t$---is important to understand and forecast the evolution of
bond yields. What matters for bond investors are the excess returns of
long-term bonds over the risk-free interest rate, and we now turn to
the question whether macroeconomic trends can help predict these
returns. While recent and parallel research
\citep{cieslak-povala,brooks-moskowitz,garg-mazzoleni} has uncovered
some predictive gains from including slow-moving averages of past
inflation and past GDP growth in excess return regression, we document
the importance of using macro
estimates of $r^\ast_t$ and of accurately detrending yields with the
resulting $i^\ast_t$. We also evaluate the significance of the predictive 
gains using a novel, more reliable method.\footnote{\cite{cieslak-povala} report substantial gains in
  such predictions from including their proxy of trend inflation---a
  slow exponentially-weighted moving average of past core CPI
  inflation---above and beyond the information contained in the yield
  curve itself. \cite{garg-mazzoleni}, in parallel work that is
  closest to our evidence on excess returns, add to this a similar
  moving average of past real GDP growth rates and find further
  gains. \cite{brooks-moskowitz} find a certain value factor useful
  for return predictions, which they define as the difference between
  bond yields and maturity-matched survey forecasts of inflation. See
  also \cite{markovich-plazzi}.}

The excess return for a holding period of $h$ quarters for
a bond with maturity $n$ is calculated as
\[
  rx_{t, t+h}^{(n)} = p_{t+h}^{(n-h)} - p_t^{(n)} - h y_t^{(h)} =
  -(n-h)y_{t+h}^{(n-h)} + n y_t^{(n)} - h y_t^{(h)}.
\]
where $p^{(n)}_t$ denotes the log-price of a zero-coupon bond with
maturity of $n$ quarters. We predict the average excess return for all
bonds with two to 15 years for holding periods of one quarter and four
quarters.\footnote{Our long-term bond yields are available only at
  annual maturities, so we calculate one-quarter returns with the
  usual approximation $y_{t+1}^{(n-1)} \approx y_{t+1}^{(n)}$.} Since
\cite{famabliss} and \cite{campbellshiller91}, it is well-known that
the yield curve, and in particular its slope, contains information
useful for predicting future excess returns. The key question is
whether the \emph{spanning hypothesis} holds, that is, whether the
current yield curve contains \emph{all} the information relevant for
predicting future returns. Spanning is implied by essentially all asset
pricing models \citep{jls,duffee-handbook-forecasting,bauer-rudebusch-spanning}, including our
illustrative model in Appendix \ref{app:dtsm}. Several studies
\citep{ludvigson-ng-rfs,jps,cieslak-povala} have documented apparent
violations of the spanning hypothesis using various additional
predictors.\footnote{Asset pricing models can be reconciled with
  evidence on unspanned macro risks by adding small measurement errors
  to model-implied yields; see \cite{duffee-info},
  \cite{cieslak-povala} and \cite{bauer-rudebusch-spanning}. Other
  possible reasons for violations of the spanning hypothesis
  include the difficulty to learn about trends in real
  time \citep{clark-kozicki} and the wedge between subjective (e.g.,
  survey-based) and objective (statistical) expectations of interest
  rates and bond returns \citep{piazzesi-salomao-schneider}.}
\cite{bauer-hamilton} revisited this evidence and demonstrated that
some of this evidence may spuriously arise from small-sample
econometric problems due to the presence of highly persistent
predictors, which renders conventional tests of the spanning
hypothesis unreliable. They found that the evidence of
\cite{cieslak-povala} on predictions with a proxy of trend inflation
was quite robust, at least in the original sample period. Our interest
here is to investigate whether including both $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$ leads to
even stronger predictive gains and more robust rejections of the spanning
hypothesis.

We begin with three specifications of the predictive regressions: The
first is the common baseline specification that includes only a
constant and the first three principal components (PCs) of yields. The
second specification just adds $\pi^\ast_t$. The
third specification also includes $r^\ast_t$ in order to
simultaneously capture the effects of both macroeconomic trends. 
The top panel of Table \ref{tab:returns} reports the
estimation results for the full sample.\footnote{We calculate White's
heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors for the case of one-quarter
returns and Newey-West standard errors with six lags for the
four-quarter returns (since the overlap introduces serial correlations
in the error term).} As in \cite{cieslak-povala}, full-sample inclusion 
of an inflation trend increases the predictive power quite substantially 
compared to only including yield-curve information: both the inflation
trend and the level of yields (PC1) appear highly
significant. However, adding $r^\ast_t$ to the regressions leads to
further impressive gains in predictive power. For both one-quarter and
four-quarter returns, the $R^2$ increases substantially, the
coefficients and $t$-statistics for $\pi^\ast_t$ and PC1 rise, and the
coefficient on $r^\ast_t$ itself is large and highly significant.
Interestingly, the coefficient on $r^\ast_t$ is about as large as the
coefficient on $\pi^\ast_t$, which confirms the prediction from our
theoretical model that these two trends play similar roles in
determining interest rates. [***TBC - interpret coefficients, equal for
macro trends, opposite sign to PC1; magnitudes -- if we scale
differently, can PC1 and i* have same absolute magnitude?]

To obtain robust inference about the incremental predictive power of macro trends,
we use the parametric bootstrap proposed by
\cite{bauer-hamilton}. This bootstrap procedure simulates artificial
data for yields and predictors under the spanning hypothesis in order to accurately gauge
the statistical significance. In this way, we calculate bootstrap
small-sample $p$-values for the coefficients on $\pi^\ast_t$ and
$r^\ast_t$. Our bootstrap simulates yields from a simple VAR(1) factor
model and the additional predictors from a separate VAR(1) model, so
that the null hypothesis---that macro trends are unimportant---holds
by construction.\footnote{Estimates of the VAR coefficients are
  bias-corrected to more accurately capture the high persistence of
  interest rates and the trend components.} The predictive regression
is estimated in each bootstrap sample, and the $t$-statistics for the
additional predictors are recorded. With this small-sample
distribution of the test statistics in hand, $p$-values are calculated
as the fraction of simulated samples in which the $t$-statistic is at
least as large (in absolute value) as the $t$-statistic in the actual
data. These $p$-values, reported in squared brackets in Table
\ref{tab:returns}, indicate that both of our trends are statistically
significant even when we account for small-sample econometric
concerns.

In the subsample starting in 1985, the inflation trend is not
statistically significant when included on its own according to the
small-sample $p$-values.\footnote{This result is consistent with
  \cite{bauer-hamilton} who in their investigation of the evidence of
  \cite{cieslak-povala} also found that in a subsample starting in
  1985 the inflation trend is only marginally significant.}  Only when
we add our measure of the equilibrium real rate do both trends matter
for bond risk premia; the coefficients on $\pi^\ast_t$ and PC1 more
than double, the $R^2$ increases substantially, and the coefficients
on $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$ are statistically significant. These
results confirm our intuition from Figure \ref{fig:data1} that the
real-rate trend has gained in importance over time relative to the
trend in inflation. Therefore, empirical analysis of long-term
interest rates implies that the trend in the real interest rate is as
important as, and recently more important than, the trend in
inflation.\footnote{In additional, unreported results we have found
  that the predictive gains from including $r^\ast_t$ are particularly
  large during the early 2000s when both $r^\ast_t$ and long-term
  interest rates decreased while long-run inflation expectations where
  anchored close to two percent.}

In the presence of persistent predictors, it is generally
difficult to interpret the magnitude of $R^2$ as a measure of
predictive accuracy, because even predictors that are irrelevant in
population can substantially increase $R^2$ in small
samples \citep{bauer-hamilton}. We can avoid this pitfall by using the
bootstrap to enerate small-sample distributions of $R^2$ under
the spanning hypothesis and
interpret the statistics obtained in the actual data by comparing them
to the quantiles of these distributions. Table
\ref{tab:returns_cycles} reports this comparison for predictive
regressions of annual excess returns for the three specifications we
have considered so far, as well as for two additional ones that will be discussed
below. Adding $\pi^\ast_t$ to the regression increases $R^2$ by 20
percentage points, but this is only barely higher than the upper end
of the 95\%-bootstrap interval, which suggests that under the null
hypothesis it would not be too uncommon to observe an increase in $R^2$ of
up to 19 percentage points. In contrast, adding $r^\ast_t$ increases $R^2$ to 54\%,
and the increase relative to the yields-only specification of 31
percentage points is much higher than what is plausible under
the null hypothesis. In the post-1985 subsample, the increase in $R^2$
from only adding $\pi^\ast_t$ is not statistically significant, whereas
the increase of 29 percentage points from adding both trends is
strongly significant.

%% detrending yields

***[TBC - expand on this. Our results suggest that we should be able to
equally well predict future returns by using detrended yields. That
is, restricted specifications where only linear combinations of y-i*
enter as predictors should give equal predictive power. Test this
restriction?]

Finally, we investigate the use of interest rate cycles, i.e.,
detrended yields, in predictive regressions for bond returns. We detrend
yields using simple differences, motivated by the theory in Section
\ref{sec:theory} and our evidence in Section \ref{sec:persistence},
and demonstrate that it is crucial to use $i^\ast_t$ instead of
$\pi^\ast_t$ for the detrending.  The first three rows of Table
\ref{tab:returns_cycles} summarize our earlier results from the
regression of excess returns on yield PCs alone, PCs jointly with
$\pi^\ast_t$, and PCs with both trends. The bottom two rows provide
results for predictions using interest rate cycles. In this case, the
predictors are the three PCs of yields that are detrended either with
$y^{(n)}_t - \pi^\ast_t$ or $y^{(n)}_t - i^\ast_t$. Using PCs of
yields that are detrended only by $\pi^\ast_t$ increases $R^2$ by 10
percentage points relative to the baseline regression with three PCs
of yields that are not detrended. But using PCs of yields that are
detrended by $i^\ast_t$, using both macro trends, increases $R^2$ by
20 percentage points. The difference is even more striking in the
later subsample that starts in 1985: $R^2$ increases only seven
percentage points when detrending with only $\pi^\ast_t$ but 28
percentage points when detrending with both $\pi_t^\ast$ and
$r^\ast_t$. We again calculate small-sample distributions of these
test statistics under the null hypothesis by running the exact same
regressions in bootstrapped samples. For the later subsample, the
increase in $R^2$ is insignificant for $\pi^\ast_t$-detrending but
strongly significant when we use the correct detrending using both
macro trends as prescribed by no-arbitrage theory.

In sum, accounting for the persistent components of yields is
important for understanding return predictability. We find that
$r^\ast_t$ has strong incremental predictive power for bond returns,
about on par with the importance of $\pi^\ast_t$ as a predictor,
suggesting that both macro trends need to be accounted for accurate
estimation of bond risk premia. The predictive power in the yield
curve is fully revealed if yields are detrended by their trend
component $i^\ast_t$.

\section{Forecasting interest rates out-of-sample}
\label{sec:forecasting}

We now turn to pseudo-out-of-sample (OOS) forecasts of long-term
interest rates. Despite many advances in yield curve modeling, the
random walk model has proven very hard to beat when forecasting bond
yields, due to the extreme persistence of interest rates
\citep{duffee02, diebold-li, duffee-handbook-forecasting}. But our
results so far suggest that one might be able to obtain more accurate
forecasts by accounting for macro trends.

In the presence of trends in inflation or the
real rate, yields exhibit a
``shifting endpoint'' \citep{kozicki-tinsley}. Specifically,
no-arbitrage theory implies, as evident from \eqref{eq:yields}, that
\[ y_t^{(n)\ast} \equiv \underset{h \rightarrow \infty}{\lim} E_t y^{(n)}_{t+h} = k^{(n)} +
\pi^\ast_t + r^\ast_t = k^{(n)} + i^\ast_t,
\]
where the constant $k^{(n)} = CONV^{(n)} + \overline{YTP}^{(n)}$
captures convexity and the unconditional mean term premium. This
implies that long-horizon forecasts of interest rates that incorporate
knowledge of $i^\ast_t$ should be more accurate than forecasts that
ignore it. The forecast method we propose uses the endpoint
$y_t^{(n)\ast} = i^\ast_t$ based on our macro estimates of
$\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$. We set the constant $k^{(n)}$ to zero to
avoid introducing additional estimation uncertainty.\footnote{We have found that including an
  estimated constant significantly worsens forecast
  performance.} The other necessary ingredient of our forecast method
is a transition path from $y_t^{(n)}$ to $y_t^{(n)\ast}$, and we
simply use a first-order autoregression for
$y_t^{(n)} - y_t^{(n)\ast}$. Denoting the (recursively) estimated autoregressive coefficient
as $\hat{\rho}_t$, the forecasts are thus constructed as
\begin{equation}
  \hat{y}^{(n)}_{t+h} = \hat{\rho}_t^h y^{(n)}_t + (1-\hat{\rho}_t^h)
  y_t^{(n)\ast}. \label{eq:forecast}
\end{equation}
We denote this forecast method as \emph{ME} for macro
endpoint.\footnote{In a fully-specified model with yields and macro
  trends---even in the simple no-arbitrage model in Appendix
  \ref{app:dtsm}---the speed of mean reversion to $y_t^{(n)\ast}$
  depends on the importance of the different cyclical factors. Our
  simple method corresponds to the special case where all cyclical
  factors have the same speed of mean reversion. Notably, the exact
  speed of mean reversion affects mainly short-horizon forecasts and
  is inconsequential for our main results.} Note that this approach
could easily be extended to provide joint forecasts of the entire
yield curve as in \cite{diebold-li} and \cite{dijk-etal}, by simply
forecasting the Nelson-Siegel level factor in the same fashion that we
here forecast each interest rate.

We compare this model to a driftless random walk as the benchmark,
i.e., $\hat{y}^{(n)}_{t+h} = y_t^{(n)}$ for all $h$ (denoted as \emph{RW}). In
addition, we consider shifting-endpoint forecasts that only use the
information in $\pi^\ast_t$, in order to assess the importance of
incorporating macro estimates of $r^\ast_t$ in interest-rate
forecasts. Specifically, this method uses
$y_t^{(n)\ast} = \pi^\ast_t + \mu^{(n)}$, where the constant is
recursively estimated as the mean of
$ y^{(n)}_t - \pi^\ast_t$.\footnote{We found that forecasts which
  assume that this constant is zero are much less accurate, which is
  unsurprising since they counterfactually assume that
  $k^{(n)} + r^\ast_t = 0$.} We denote these ``inflation-only''
forecasts as \emph{IO}. Finally we include forecasts from a
constant-endpoint model, namely a stationary AR(1) process (\emph{AR}).

We forecast the five- and ten-year yields and the five-to-ten-year
forward rate. At each point in time, starting in 1976:Q1 (at $t=20$)
when five years of data are available, we forecast each interest rate
at horizons ($h$) of 4, 10, 20, 30, and 40 quarters. As indicated
above, forecasts are constructed using a recursive scheme, using all
data available up to the forecast date to estimate
parameters.\footnote{A rolling scheme, which uses only a fixed number of
  observations for parameter estimation, allows for an easier
  asymptotic justification of tests for predictive ability
  \citep{giacomini-white} but requires a specific choice of the
  window length. We have also obtained forecasts with such a scheme,
  using a variety of different window lengths, and found equally
  strong forecast gains for model \emph{ME} as using a recursive scheme.}  Table
\ref{tab:yield_forecasts} reports the root-mean-squared errors (RMSEs)
and mean-absolute errors (MAEs), in percentage points. We also
calculate $p$-values for tests of equal finite-sample forecast
accuracy using the approach of \cite{diebold-mariano}
(DM).\footnote{Following common use, we construct the DM test with a
  rectangular window for the long-run variance and the small-sample
  adjustment of \cite{harvey-leybourne-newbold}. Monte Carlo evidence
  in \cite{clark-mccracken} indicates that this test has good size in
  finite samples. However, for very long forecast horizons the
  long-run variance is estimated with considerable uncertainty as in
  those cases there are only few non-overlapping observations in our
  sample.} We calculate these DM $p$-values, using standard normal
critical values, for one-sided tests of the null hypothesis that our
proposed model \emph{ME} does not improve upon the \emph{RW} and
\emph{IO} forecasts. We find that model \emph{ME} achieves substantial
and statistically significant gains in forecast accuracy at long
horizons. Such gains are evident for both RMSEs and MAEs, but are
larger and more strongly significant for absolute-error loss. For
example, when forecasting the ten-year yield five years ahead, model
\emph{ME} lowers the RMSE by over 25\% relative to \emph{RW}, an
improvement that is significant at the five-percent level, while the
MAE drops by more than 40\% and is significant at the one percent
level. Model \emph{ME} also improves upon \emph{IO} by a magnitude
that is typically large and statistically significant.\footnote{We
  have found in additional, unreported analysis---using plots of
  differences in cumulative sums of forecast errors over time---that
  the forecast gains of \emph{ME} are not driven by certain unusual
  sub-periods, but instead are a consistent pattern over most of our
  sample period.}

These results document that at long horizons one can significantly
improve upon random walk interest rate forecasts by incorporating
information on $i^\ast_t$, the underlying macroeconomic trend in
interest rates. In face of the high persistence of yields, using the
random walk amounts to surrendering as it simply assumes all changes
are permanent, whereas using estimates of $i^\ast_t$ instead captures
the underlying source of this persistence, with large benefits for
forecast accuracy. Furthermore, it is clearly important to incorporate
macro estimates of $r^\ast_t$ in addition to information on
$\pi^\ast_t$, because this substantially improves the accuracy of the estimated
shifting endpoint in yields.\footnote{The source of the forecast gains
  of model \emph{ME} relative to \emph{IO} is the lower level of
  $r^\ast_t$. Model \emph{IO} uses in effect the (recursively
  estimated) mean of the difference between yields and $\pi^\ast_t$ as
  its estimate of $r^\ast_t$, which over most of the sample period was
  too high.} Earlier research by \cite{dijk-etal} found that when
forecasting interest rates it is beneficial to link long-run
projections of interest rates to long-run expectations of inflation,
which however ignores the role of time variation in $r^\ast_t$. In
addition our results also show that there is no need to estimate a
constant or to scale the endpoint \citep[as in][]{dijk-etal} once a
macro-based estimate of $r^\ast_t$ is incorporated into $i^\ast_t$.

Finally we compare the accuracy of our statistical models to that of
professional forecasters for predicting the ten-year yield. Since
1988, the Blue Chip Financial Forecasts (\emph{BC}) survey has asked
its respondents for long-range forecasts twice a year. The respondents
provide their average expectations of the target variable for each of
the upcoming five calendar years and for the subsequent five-year
period---we will focus on the five annual forecast
horizons.\footnote{For survey dates in the fourth quarter, one calendar
  year is typically skipped. We use the exact years from the actual
  survey to line up our forecasts.} We match the available information sets
by using only data up to the quarter preceding the survey date for our
model-based forecasts, and we exactly match the forecast horizons with
the \emph{BC} forecasts by taking averages of model-based forecasts
over the relevant calendar years. The sample includes 46 forecast
dates from March 1988 to December 2010. Table
\ref{tab:yield_forecasts_bc} shows the RMSEs and MAEs of the survey
forecasts and the four model-based forecasts. Shifting-endpoint
forecasts based on $i^\ast_t$ improve substantially over both
\emph{RW} and \emph{BC} forecasts in this sample. The gains relative
to \emph{RW} are strongly significant for horizons beyond the first
calendar year, and the gains relative to \emph{BC} are significant at
the five- or ten-percent level. The reason for the poor performance of
the survey forecasts is that they consistently over-predict future
yields at these long horizons: The difference between long-range
survey forecasts of the ten-year yield and our (survey-based) estimate
of $\pi^\ast_t$ is much larger than our macro-based estimate of
$r^\ast_t$ (results not shown). Other studies have documented the poor
performance of survey forecasts of interest rates
\citep[e.g.,][]{dijk-etal}, which contrasts with the very good
performance of survey-based inflation
forecasts\citep{abw-jme,faust-wright}. Our results suggest that the
underlying reason for this poor performance is that professional
forecasters have in the past overestimated the trend component in
interest rates.

\section{The term premium in long-term yields}
\label{sec:tp}

The term premium is a central object of interest in most empirical
analysis of the yield curve. It is defined as the difference between
holding an $n$-month bond to maturity or facing a sequence of 1-period
rates over the same period:
\[ TP_t^{(n)} = y_t^{(n)} - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} E_t
  y^{(1)}_{t+j}. \] Estimation of the term premium requires
expectations of future short-term rates, which is commonly obtained
from a stationary VAR that underlies either a no-arbitrage model or a
simple factor model. However, our results suggest that the
stationarity assumption is problematic for long-horizon
forecasts. Therefore we now investigate how it affects the estimated
term premium if we allow for time variation in the long-run trend
component $i^\ast_t$.\footnote{The term premium can be defined using
  subjective or statistical expectations
  \citep{piazzesi-salomao-schneider}. Our focus here is squarely on
  the latter.}

[TBC] Decompositions of long-term interest rates into short-rate
expectations and term premia are commonly obtained from a variety of
dynamic models ranging from simple factor models to no-arbitrage term
structure models. We employ the former in this section, by estimating a
time-series process for yield curve PCs and fitting the cross section of
yields using the PC loadings.\footnote{The results from such a factor model
  will be essentially identical to those from a model that imposes
  maximally-flexible no-arbitrage restrictions on the loadings of
  yields on risk factors \citep{duffee-forecasting, jls}. Still, \cite{cp08}
  and \cite{bauer-rrp} emphasized that restricting the prices of risk can
  let the cross-sectional behavior of yields help pin down the
  time-series specification for yields, which could be relevant for developing
  no-arbitrage models that incorporate our findings.} Short-rate expectations are then
calculated from the VAR forecasts of the yield PCs and the PC loadings
of the short rate. Our model uses three PCs calculated from 15 Treasury yields
with maturities from one year to 15 years over an estimation sample
from 1971:Q4 to 2007:Q4. We
omit the period of near-zero short-rates beginning in 2008, since the
lower bound on nominal interest rates poses problems for linear factor
models \citep{bauer-rudebusch-zlb}.

To provide a conventional baseline measure of the term premium, we
estimate a first-order annual VAR(1) in quarterly observations using
the first three PCs of interest rates.\footnote{That is,
  the PCs are regressed on an intercept and the one-year lagged
  values of the PCs, a specification motivated by the evidence of \cite{cp05} that the
  dynamics of risk premia are more evident at the annual frequency
  \citep[see also][]{cp08}.}
In line with the underlying structure of the majority of no-arbitrage
models, this is a stationary VAR. For example, \cite{cp08} estimated
an annual VAR(1) for five interest rates in monthly observations, and
our results closely parallel theirs. In the top-left panel of Figure
\ref{fig:tp}, we plot the model-implied expectations of the one-year
yield at different horizons, as well as the observed one-year
yield. As emphasized by \cite{cp08}, stationary VARs for the levels of
interest rates imply forecasts that quickly revert to the
unconditional mean of the short rate (which is 6.5 percent). The top-right
panel of Figure \ref{fig:tp} shows the five-to-ten-year forward rate
with its expectations and term premium components. (Results for the ten-year
yield are qualitatively similar.) Not surprisingly, in light of the
behavior of model-implied forecasts, the expectations component is
very stable, hovering around the short-rate mean. Therefore, the term
premium, as the residual component, has to account for
the trend in the long-term interest rate since the 1980s.
As argued by \cite{kim-orphanides} and \cite{brw2}, such behavior of
expectations and term premium components appears at odds with observed
trends in survey-based expectations \citep{kozicki-tinsley} and the
cyclical behavior of risk premia in asset prices
\citep{campbell-cochrane}.

To incorporate a trend component into forecasts of the yield curve, we
instead model detrended yields as a stationary VAR. That is, we
subtract $i^\ast_t$ from each yield as called
for by the evidence in Sections
\ref{sec:persistence}--\ref{sec:returns}, calculate three PCs of
detrended yields, and again estimate an annual VAR(1). We calculate
the term premium by forecasting the detrended interest rates and adding the
trend back in to obtain the expected path of future short rates.
The bottom two panels of Figure \ref{fig:tp} show the implications of
this model for expectations and the term premium. As the forecast
horizon increases, short-rate expectations
approach the trend component $i^\ast_t$
instead of the unconditional mean of the short rate. Consequently, the expectations
component reflects the movements in $i^\ast_t$ and accounts for the
low-frequency movements in the long-term forward rate. The term
premium, by contrast, behaves in a cyclical fashion with no
discernible trend. The drop in the forward rate from its average during 1980-1982 to
its average during 2005-2007 was about 7.5 percentage points. In the conventional VAR
of interest rates, the estimated term premium accounts for over 80\% of
this decline. In contrast, the VAR with detrended yields attributes only
a quarter of this decline to the term premium. This
stark difference demonstrates how
accounting for the slow-moving trend component in interest rates
fundamentally alters our understanding of the driving forces of
long-term interest rates.

This model---a VAR for interest rate cycles conditional on estimates
of the trend $i_t^\ast$---provides a simple but effective way to
account for a common trend (i.e., shifting endpoints) in bond
yields. In addition to estimation of the term premium, it could be
useful in related applications, such as in forecasting the entire
yield curve jointly, or for calculating of expected returns for any
bond and holding period. While it does not impose no-arbitrage it is
otherwise consistent with equation \eqref{eq:yields} and captures the
role of time-variation in $i^\ast_t$ for bond yields.

\section{Variance contributions}
\label{sec:horizons}

Our results suggest that changes in macroeconomic trends and
$i^\ast_t$ should play an important role in accounting for interest
rate changes at low frequencies, i.e., over intervals of several
years. We use variance ratios to compare the size of fluctuations in $r^\ast_t$,
$\pi^\ast_t$ and $i^\ast_t$ with those of long-term nominal bond yields. We extend
the results of \cite{duffee-inflation-risk}, who finds that news about
future inflation is generally small relative to the innovations in
nominal yields, by considering movements in both $r^\ast_t$ and
$\pi^\ast_t$ and at horizons greater than just one quarter. If macro trends
are important for yields we should see a clear tendency for variance ratios of changes in the trend
components relative to yield changes to rise with the period of the change.

The variance ratio used by Duffee divides the variance of quarterly innovations to average inflation
expectations over $n$ periods by the variance of innovations to the
bond yield for maturity $n$. We generalize this measure to allow for
innovations to occur not only over one quarter but to accumulate over $h$ quarters:
\[
  VR_h^{(n)} = \frac{Var\left((E_t-E_{t-h})n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n
    \pi_{t+i}\right)}{Var\left((E_t-E_{t-h}) y_t^{(n)}\right)}
\]
An important result of Duffee's analysis is that even for long-term
bonds, $VR_1^{(n)}$ appears to be surprisingly small. That is,
one-period changes in expected average future inflation are much less
variable than one-period surprises in long-term bond yields.
This result can be interpreted using equation \eqref{eq:yields}. One
possible explanation is that at a quarterly frequency the trend in inflation
moves much less than the term premium component of long-term interest
rates. This interpretation is
consistent with additional evidence in Duffee's paper on the role of
the term premium and with a large body of evidence on excess
volatility of interest rates, going back to
\cite{shiller-79}.

But quarterly innovations are in this context a ``high-frequency''
perspective, given that the goal is to understand the long history of
U.S.~Treasury yields. For a more complete understanding of the link
between inflation expectations and bond yields we need to consider
horizons longer than $h=1$. This appears particularly promising for understanding
the role of trends, because
$\underset{h \rightarrow \infty}{\lim} VR_h^{(n)}$
is only affected by changes in trend components.\footnote{This
  statement assumes that the
term premium is stationary, an assumption generally made in
yield-curve modeling which is also supported by our findings in
Section \ref{sec:persistence}.} Of course the variance ratios become
harder to estimate with increasing $h$ as the overlap of observations
increases and one loses degrees of freedom and precision. However,
despite the increasing estimation uncertainty, the profile of variance
ratios across horizons can provide evidence about the role of
low-frequency movements in macro trends for interest rate dynamics.

Estimation of the these variance ratios requires expectations of inflation
and interest rates. Like Duffee we consider survey-based inflation
expectations (in our measure of $\pi^\ast_t$) and
martingale interest rate forecasts. But instead of modeling the
inflation process we approximate inflation news by the change in
$\pi^\ast_t$. This allows us to calculate the simplified variance ratio
\[
\widetilde{VR}_h^{(n)} = \frac{Var\left(\Delta_h \pi^\ast_t\right)}{Var\left( \Delta_h
  y_t^{(n)}\right)}, \qquad \Delta_h z_t = z_t - z_{t-h}.
\]
For any given $n$ and $h$, $\widetilde{VR}_h^{(n)}$ differs from
$VR_h^{(n)}$ because we former ignores changes in the inflation cycles
and includes anticipated changes in yields. However, these differences
are likely to be small for longer horizons $h$ since
\[
\underset{h \rightarrow \infty}{\lim} \widetilde{VR}_h^{(n)} = \underset{h
  \rightarrow \infty}{\lim} VR_h^{(n)} = \frac{Var(\Delta
  \pi^\ast_t)}{Var(\Delta i^\ast_t)}.
\]
Thus, for low-frequency movements, the two inflation variance ratios
are asymptotically identical and capture the importance of the
inflation trend for the overall yield trend.

Figure \ref{fig:vr} shows estimates of $\widetilde{VR}_h^{(n)}$ for
changes from one quarter to $h=40$ quarters in the five-year yield,
the ten-year yield, and the 5-to-10-year forward rate. This shows the
relative importance of fluctuations in long-run inflation
expectations. Similarly, we also calculate these variance ratios for
the contribution of changes in the real-rate trend, $r^\ast_t$, and in
the overall trend component $i^\ast_t = \pi^\ast_t + r^\ast_t$, simply
by replacing the variance in the numerator of
$\widetilde{VR}_h^{(n)}$.

For the inflation trend, we find that one-quarter variance ratios are
around 0.1. This result is consistent with Duffee's findings and
suggests that changes in the inflation trend play a small role for
variation in yields at the quarterly frequency. At lower frequencies,
however, the relative variability of the inflation trend
increases. The point estimates of the $\pi^\ast_t$-variance ratio
quickly rise with the horizon, and for $h=40$ reach a magnitude of
around 0.3. This shows that inflation expectations are of substantial
importance for movements in bond yields once we shift the focus from
month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter variation and look at lower
frequencies changes over several years, which are arguably more relevant
for long-term bond investors.

The variance ratio for changes in the real-rate trend, i.e.,
$Var(\Delta_h r^\ast_t)/Var(\Delta_h y_t)$, is much lower than for
inflation, remaining below 0.1 even at long
horizons. This is unsurprising in light of Figure \ref{fig:data1},
which shows that over the full sample the movements in $r^\ast_t$ were
substantially less pronounced than movements in long-term interest
rates and the inflation trend.\footnote{This finding may partly reflect
our use of an average of different estimates for $r^\ast_t$---some of
the individual estimates exhibit distinctly more volatility.} Of
course, this perspective of unconditional
variances should not be taken to conclude that changes in the
equilibrium real rate are unimportant for interest rate dynamics,
given the ample evidence in Sections
\ref{sec:persistence}--\ref{sec:returns} of the crucial role of
$r^\ast_t$ for modeling and forecasting interest
rates. Furthermore, in more recent subsamples, variance ratios should
suggest that $r^\ast_t$ has become a more important driver of changes in
long-term interest rates.

To assess the overall importance of the trend components in interest
rates, we consider variance ratios for $i^\ast_t$, i.e.,
$Var(\Delta_h i^\ast_t)/Var(\Delta_h y_t)$. Confidence intervals are
obtained using the asymptotic distribution of the sample variances and
the delta method. To account for persistence in conditional variances,
Newey-West estimates of long-run variances are used.\footnote{We use
  12 quarterly lags for all long-run variance estimates as indicated
  by the automatic lag selection procedure of Newey and West. These
  confidence intervals may understate the true sampling variability
  due to the small number of non-overlapping observations, which
  decreases the reliability of the asymptotic approximations.}  Figure
\ref{fig:vr} shows that while the sampling uncertainty around the
variance ratios for changes in $i^\ast_t$ is substantial we can be
reasonably confident that these variance ratios increase from below
0.15 to a range of around 0.25 to 0.4, depending on the maturity of
the interest rate. The highest levels are reached for the 5-to-10-year
forward rate---the confidence interval at $h=40$ extends from about
0.3 to 0.4---which is consistent with the notion that distant forward
rates are more strongly affected by the trend components.

While our theoretical model implies that the variance ratios for $i^\ast_t$ approach one
for sufficiently large $h$, our estimates top out around
0.4. One possible explanation is
that we are simply not capturing the trend component with sufficient
accuracy. Although we have provided
ample evidence that our trend proxies are closely linked to the
low-frequency movements in interest rates, the true trend components might be more (or
less) variable than our measures. Additionally, we may not be able to consider
large enough $h$ given the available data sample. Finally,
it may be that the risk-premium
factor itself is sufficiently persistent that it drives
interest rate variation at such low frequencies.

To shed further light on this topic,
it is useful to consider not only the direct contribution of changes
in the trend to changes in interest rates, but also indirect
contributions, due to covariance terms. In Table \ref{tab:vr}, we
report the variances of changes in interest rates, in the trend
component $i^\ast_t$, and in the cycle components $y_t -
i^\ast_t$. The variance of yield changes can be decomposed as follows:
\[
Var(\Delta_h y_t) = Var(\Delta_h i^\ast_t) + Var(\Delta_h y_t -
\Delta_h i^\ast_t) + 2 Cov(\Delta_h i^\ast_t, \Delta_h y_t -
\Delta_h i^\ast_t).
\]
The first term captures the direct contribution of trends, whereas the
last term captures the their indirect contribution to movements in
yields. Table \ref{tab:vr} reports all three components. In the data,
the contribution of the covariance is small at short horizons, but
substantial at long horizons. The two last rightmost columns of Table
\ref{tab:vr} report the same variance ratio shown in Figure
\ref{fig:vr} along with a ratio that also includes the covariance
contribution---the indirect effects---in the numerator. This second
ratio rises to over 0.7 with horizon, which suggests that the
cycle component accounts for less than 30\% of the variance
of interest rate changes at low frequencies.\footnote{Note that our theoretical
  model, which assumed that shocks to trend and cycle
  components are uncorrelated, would need to be generalized to
  provide a model-based interpretation of these results.} These
estimates confirm that after accounting for both direct and
indirect effects, changes in macro trends play an important
role in low-frequency movements in interest rates.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have provided new evidence that interest rates and risk pricing are
substantially driven by time variation in the trend in inflation and the equilibrium real
rate of interest. Our empirical approach employed existing
estimates of these macroeconomic trends to investigate
this relationship from a variety of perspectives. We showed
that accounting for these trend components can help understand, model, and forecast long-term interest rates
and bond returns. Our results confirm the predictions of no-arbitrage
theory for the links between macroeconomic trends and the yield curve,
and they demonstrate that these links are quantitatively important.

Our findings open up several avenues for future research. Most
importantly, they demonstrate the advantages of yield curve models
that allow for slow-moving changes in the long-run mean of
inflation and the real rate. This applies to both reduced-form
no-arbitrage models as well as to more structural, equilibrium models
of the yield curve. The purpose of specifying and estimating such
models is typically to understand bond risk premia/term premia and
risk compensation. Calculating the required long-run expectations without
accounting for changes in the underlying trends is likely to give
misleading results for risk premia. To avoid this pitfall we recommend
that shifting macro trends should be incorporated in future models of
the term structure of interest rates.

Our analysis should be viewed as a first step in the integration of
macroeconomic trends into yield curve modeling. We took estimates of
macroeconomic trends from surveys and models and treated them as
data. While this is a useful starting point, future research will have
to investigate the role of model and estimation uncertainty for the
links between macro trends and the yield curve. Another important
additional dimension to consider is potential change over time in the
relative importance of the macroeconomic trends in accounting for
long-run interest rates. For example, it is well known in empirical
macroeconomics \citep[e.g.,][]{stock-watson-ucsv} that the trend
component of inflation was much more variable in the 1970s and 1980s than
in more recent decades. This raises the question how our (mostly
unconditional) results are affected by taking a conditional
perspective. Furthermore, this suggests that incorporating not only
macroeconomic trends but also stochastic volatility in these trend
components will be useful for term structure modeling.
