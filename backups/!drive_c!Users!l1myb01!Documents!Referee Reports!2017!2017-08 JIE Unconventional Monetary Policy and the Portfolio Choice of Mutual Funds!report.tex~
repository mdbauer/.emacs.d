\section{Summary}
\label{sec:org56b8bfe}

This paper attempts to estimate how mutual fund manager changed their asset
allocation in response to unconventional monetary policy (UMP) by the Fed,
BoE, BoJ and ECB. It uses a global data set on the holdings and
positions in different countries that were reported by mutual
funds. These holdings are regressed on dummies for UMP announcements
and central bank balance sheet measures, in a dynamic panel
specification that includes a lagged dependent variable, macro
controls, a time trend, and fixed
effects. The estimates are in some cases significant, suggesting that
portfolio managers substitute away from countries in which the central
bank conducts UMPs. However, by and large the estimates are
economically small and often insignificant. 

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:org35ccda1}

There are still many open questions with regard to the effects and
channels of UMP. These mainly pertain to the macroeconomic effects of
UMP measures, as a large body of work has already documented the
financial market effects. But there are still a few open issues also
with regard to the effects on asset prices. The paper addreses the
worthwhile question how the announcements and implementations of UMP
measures have affected markets through a portfolio balance channel. A
lot of work has been done in this area, so this is not exactly an open
question, but new work could still add to our understanding of these issues.

However, this paper does not add any substantial new insights to the
literature on UMP and balance sheet policies. Its main finding is that
there are some portfolio balance effects, but they are found to be
small. Of course, it is well known that there are portfolio balance
effects, and it is in no way surprising that portfolio managers would
rebalance their portfolios in this way. Furthermore the finding that these effects are small is not a
definite result about the portfolio balance channel in general, but is
more likely due to the specific empirical design of the paper, about which I have some significant
concerns. Overall, neither the empirical nor the methodological
contribution is substantial enough to warrant publication in a top
field journal. 

My main concern about the methodology is that exclusive focus is on
variation of portfolios within mutual funds. This is a very narrow
focus and a peculiar approach to try to identify portfolio balance
effects. Mutual funds generally have a very clearly defined investment
objective, which severely restricts the freedom of the portfolio
manager to actively shift holdings between asset classes, regions, countries,
or risk classes. At an extreme, index fund managers have no freedom at
all. The authors briefly note that they exclude "index funds whose geographical allocation is
mechanically linked to the country weightings used in the composition
of a benchmark". They need to remove all index funds (and then report
what share/amount of AUM is left). But even in the case of non-index
mutual funds, the mandate of the portfolio manager imposes many
restrictions on them. While the extent these
restrictions varies, their importance for the results of the paper
could be large. So we don't know whether portfolio managers don't
rebalance portfolios much because of institutional constraints or
because portfolio balance effects of UMP are truly small.

Another concern is that changes in portfolio weights can be driven
either by past performance or by active portfolio rebalancing. How do
we know whether managers shifted funds into emerging market assets or
whether these assets simply outperformed other asset classes and as a
consequence make up an increasingly large portion of portfolios? The
regressions include the current month's return, possibly with the goal
of controlling for this effect, but it is the entire past (relative)
performance that determines current portfolio shares. The reader
remains confused why the results are interpreted as being due to the
rebalancing decisions of portfolio managers. The paper argues in the
introduction that in contrast to existing studies it
somehow does not need to worry about wealth effects, but the problem
it does not to worry about is actually closely related, as it also
pertains to past performance. 

The estimates capture the conditional correlations between UMP
surprise/balance sheet measures and portfolio shares, but why should
these be causal effects? In particular the balance sheet measures more
or less continuously increased over the course of the QE measures, so
anything that happened around the time that QE was being implemented,
and led to increasing shares of certain regions within mutual fund
portfolios, could be mistakenly attributed to QE. This includes, but
is not limited to, the abovementioned possible outperformance of
certain regions. Like many readers will, I question that the
coefficients on the balance sheet variable capture the causal effects
of QE.

The regression for some reason includes a linear time trend that is
common to all funds and regions. This makes no sense at all, as all
region shares within one portfolio could never exhibit the same time
trend. Either the notation or the specification is wrong. It is also
unclear what the authors intended by including this time trend. 

The econometric specification is a complicated dynamic panel
regression, which poses all kinds of problems to obtain reliable
inference. The authors in passing mention the use of Dricoll-Kraay
standard errors and Nickell bias, and that their number of time
periods is supposedly large, but it is hard for the reader to be
convinced of the robustness of the specification. The addition of
about 50 pages of appendix tables with regression results for
alternative specification is not useful, in my view, as it poses an
unreasonably high burden on the reader to read and interpret these
results and verify the robustness. All of these specifications are
still complex and suffer from similar econometric concerns. Instead, I
recommend that the authors show in the most simple terms possible what
the patterns in the data look like, before going to more sophisticated
specifications which may obfuscate what is really going on. I suggest,
for example, a few scatter plots of the changes in region shares
against UMP balance sheet measures. This will reveal whether there is
an obvious pattern in the data. The authors can then go on to argue
why more sophisticated specifications are needed and present further
results.

The paper also needs a clearer conceptual framework regarding the
channels of UMP and the empirical questions it is trying to answer. In
the introduction it lists three hypotheses and three ways for UMP to
work through the "portfolio rebalancing channel" (which really should
be the "portfolio balance channel"), among which is the signalling
channel. This discussion is confusing and inconsistent with the
distinction of the channels of balance sheet policies commonly used in
the literature.
