\section{Summary}
\label{sec-1}

This paper investigates different variants of a DSGE model with an
Effective Lower Bound (ELB) on the short-term nominal interest rate,
i.e., on the policy rate, with the goal of learning about the effects
of the ELB on the term structure of interest rates and the term
premium. A stylized version of the model is used to understand a basic
mechanism: At the ELB there are two opposing forces on the term
premium, with additional uncertainty pushing the term premium up and
reduced sensitivity of interest rates pulling the term premium down,
both in absolute terms. It appears that the second effect typically
dominates so that the term premium is compressed at the ELB. The
authors include a more general version of the model for quantitative
analysis, which they calibrate to match sample moments of
macroeconomic and yield curve data.  This model is able to match
key features of macro-finance data, including large, positive, and
volatile term premiums away from the ELB as well as small and
negative term premiums at the ELB. The model is used to analyze the
policy experiment of extending forward guidance, implemented by
changing the policy rule to a Reifschneider-Williams rule which is
promises "lower-for-longer" at the ELB. The forward guidance reduces
the term premium in absolute value, but the direction of the effect
depends on the sign of the term premium, which differs between two
calibrations.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec-2}

The paper addresses the important question how the zero/effective lower bound
affects the yield curve and term premiums, and what this means for
monetary policy. By providing a careful analysis of this issue in a
quantitative DSGE model that features an ELB, it fills an important
gap in the macro-finance literature. The paper makes both
a methodological and an empirical contribution to this
literature. However, to be publishable the authors need to convince
the reader that the model-based results are credible by better
validating and substantiating the model's assumptions and
restrictions. In addition, the paper needs to explain the practical
implications and lessons from the analysis, as well as its broader
relevance. In the following I describe the changes to the paper that I view as
necessary. The next section makes some additional suggestions that
would improve the paper.

\subsection{Which model should we trust and why?}
\label{sec-2-1}

There are a number of different model versions in the paper: the
stylized model in different versions, and the quantitative model in
different incarnations. The reader is left confused about what model
(version) is central to the paper, and what is icing on the cake. It is
particular disadvantageous that one of the key results---about the
effects of forward guidance on term premiums---differs depending on
which calibration of the model is used.

I recommend that the authors focus the paper on only one
model. Additional results can be mentioned in the text or footnotes,
or included in online appendices. The authors need to choose their
favorite model, and explain the reasons for this choice, i.e.,
carefully motivate the modeling assumptions. As it is, the reader is
left wondering which of the "alternative calibrations" she should
believe. Focusing on one model would also allow the authors to tighten
up the exposition and steamlining it, instead of having to go back and
forth between different models.

In addition, the authors need to provide a better evaluation and
validation of the chosen model. The literature provides many examples
of ways to do this: matching impulse-response functions to
macroeconomic shocks; demonstrating that not only the moments targeted
by the calibration but also other moments are matched by the model;
simulating data from the model and showing that it has similar
features as the actual data. On the last point, one could run
Campbell-Shiller regressions in simulated yield data to show that the
model matches deviations from the expectations hypothesis, as
suggested by Dai and Singleton (2002, JFE). This is just one of many
options. The authors need to convince the reader that the model can be
trusted. Currently, either the model implications are presented
without a view of the data (figures 1,2,3,5,6,7) or the data is presented
without comparison with the model (figures 4,8). The exception are
Tables 4 and 5, but it is unclear which moments are targeted by free
model parameters and which are matched without being targeted.

\subsection{How does the model compare with existing models?}
\label{sec-2-2}

The methodological contribution needs to be further clarified by
comparing the model to existing DSGE yield-curve models. Many are
mentioned on page 5, but the benefits of the proposed model vis-a-vis
those models is not completely clear. For example, does the model
produce similar average values and dynamics for the term premium as
the best existing models (slope of nominal/real yield curve,
variability of term premium, etc)? And does the variation in the term premium
come from the same channels or from a new channel? Does it all come
down to the ELB, i.e., would a version of the model without the ELB
completely fail at matching yield curve dynamics? The statement on
page 5 "volatility in term premiums arises naturall from the presence
of the ELB constraint" as well as figure 2 suggest that term premiums
vary \emph{only} due to the ELB, which appears counterfactual. The term
premium was varying long before people knew that the economy may hit the ELB.

Here I am not suggesting a lot of additional analysis; the author just need
to compare their model with and differentiate it from existing
models. A key question in this context is: Could we just introduce the
ELB into a model by Swanson, Andreasen, or Dew-Becker, use global
solution methods, and we would get the same results?

\subsection{Implications for monetary policy and broader relevance}
\label{sec-2-3}

While the authors do a great job to explain the intuition and
mechanics of the model---this is a great strength of the paper---they
need to try much harder to show and explain the broader relevance of
the paper within the macro-finance and monetary economics
literature. In particular, I strongly urge the authors to discuss the implications of the model's
results for our understanding of macro-finance interactions at the ELB, for the
conduct of monetary policy at the ELB, and for the macroeconomic
effects of the ELB. The overarching question is what we can learn from
the model. I think the framework is quite useful and the authors are
currently underselling the paper.

\section{Suggestions}
\label{sec-3}

\begin{itemize}
\item The repeated mention of an extension of the model to include balance
sheet effects is not helpful. That would require a very different
kind of model. Instead of mentioning other things that one could do
in other models, I recommend focusing on what we can learn from this
model.

\item The model implies estimates of the shadow rate $R_t^\ast$. The
authors could consider comparing these to existing measures. Both
Wu-Xia and Bauer-Rudebusch have their shadow rate estimates
online. However, it would also be important to discuss that the
shadow rate in a reduced-form term structure model is a different
construct than the shadow rate in this model, where I would probably rather
characterize $R^\ast_t$ as the "desired policy rate."

\item It's not clear whether the exogenous discount rate process is
standard or a novelty in this paper. Since this is the key demand
shock, it would probably be worth motivating it better. I was also
wondering whether the fact that $\beta_t$ can exceed one could be a
problem. A related point is that figures 1 and 2 focus exclusively
on functions ("decision rules" seems to be a misnomer for at least
Figure 2) of $\beta$, which would be useful to motivate better.
