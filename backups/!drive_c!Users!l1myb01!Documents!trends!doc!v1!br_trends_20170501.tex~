\section{Introduction}

The level of the risk-free real rate of return that would prevail in
the absence of transitory disturbances has long been of interest to
researchers, policymakers, and financial investors.
However, recent structural changes in the global economy have brought
questions about the variation and influence of this equilibrium real rate
to the forefront \citep{clarida-new-neutral,yellen-pace}. Various
underlying fundamental economic forces,
such as lower productivity growth and an aging population, appear
to have slowly altered global saving and investment and, in turn,
pushed down the steady-state real interest rate. Accordingly, much
new research has examined potential changes in the level of the
equilibrium real short-term interest rate, which we denote
as $r^\ast_t$.\footnote{\label{fn:rstar} Discussions of the
  decline in $r^\ast$ include \cite{hhhw}, \cite{rachel-smith},
  \cite{laubach-williams}, \cite{johannsen-mertens}, \cite{kiley},
  \cite{lubik-mathes}, \cite{christensen-rudebusch-rstar}, and \cite{holston-laubach-williams} among
  many others.} Remarkably, there has thus far been very little work in finance
addressing the effects of changes in $r^\ast_t$ on the dynamics of the
term structure of interest rates.\footnote{A notable exception is
  \cite{abw}, who allow regime switching in the mean of the real short
  rate.} We fill this gap and analyze how changes in the equilibrium real
rate will alter yield curves and bond risk pricing.

A simple illustration of the potential importance of accounting for
the equilibrium real rate is provided in Figure \ref{fig:data1}. The
secular decline in the 10-year Treasury yield since the early 1980s
exemplifies the gradual fall in the general level of U.S. interest
rates. Early on, a key driver of this decline was a reduction in the
long-run expected level of inflation, which is often referred to as
trend inflation and denoted as $\pi^\ast_t$. Figure \ref{fig:data1}
displays a measure of trend inflation based largely on long-horizon
inflation projections from a survey of professional forecasters
(details of this measure are described in the data section
below). While the link between trend inflation and interest rates is
widely recognized, e.g., \cite{cieslak-povala}, it obviously does not
account for all of the decline in yields. For the past two decades,
$\pi^\ast_t$ has stabilized around 2 percent while longer-term
interest rates have continued to drift lower. Indeed, much of the
recent downtrend in yields appears to reflect a lower equilibrium real
short-term interest rate, as is evident in the simple composite
measure of $r^\ast_t$ shown in Figure \ref{fig:data1} (details of this
measure are also described below). According to this measure, the
equilibrium real short rate remained little changed in a range between
2 and 3 percent from 1970 to around 2000 when it started to gradually
fall to below 1 percent currently. We argue that accounting for this
recent downtrend in $r^\ast_t$ as well as the earlier decline
in $\pi^\ast_t$---that is, an environment of falling stars---is critical for
understanding the dynamics of interest rates and for assessing bond
risk and expected returns.

Nominal interest rates reflect expectations of future
inflation and real short rates---including their trend
components---subject to a risk adjustment. We illustrate the importance of
the trend components in an affine no-arbitrage term structure model that allows
for stochastic trends in inflation and the real short
rate---$\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$. The model shows that $\pi^\ast_t$
and $r^\ast_t$ act as level factors for the nominal yield curve, as
suggested by Figure \ref{fig:data1}. In addition, the model describes
how the cyclical components of inflation and the real rate affect
short rates more than long rates and how a risk-premium factor affects
long rates more than short rates. All of these theoretical model
propositions lead to testable implications about the importance of
both $r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$ for interest rates. We take four of
these implications to the data. This empirical examination considers
four tests of whether the trends in inflation and the real rate
are quantitatively important for interest rate determination.

As a first test, we document that time variation in both $\pi^\ast_t$ and
$r^\ast_t$ is responsible for most of the persistence in yields. While
interest rates themselves are extremely persistent, the difference
between long-term interest rates and the nominal equilibrium short
rate, which is denoted $i^\ast_t = \pi^\ast_t + r^\ast_t$,
exhibits quick mean reversion. Furthermore, regressions
of long-term yields on the macroeconomic trends recover the unit
coefficients predicted by our theoretical model. Our findings generalize
the results of \cite{cieslak-povala}, henceforth CP,
who regress nominal yields on a proxy for trend inflation. While
we confirm their finding that $\pi^\ast_t$ is an important persistent
component of interest rates, we show that it is also crucial to
include $r^\ast_t$ in order to fully capture the
trend component. After accounting for shifts in $r_t^\ast$, we
uncover strong evidence for a long-run Fisher effect, which has
found at best lukewarm support in previous studies that have
focused only on a bivariate relation between yields and inflation.
Instead, we find that the trends
components of inflation and the real rate are related to interest
rates exactly as standard finance theory predicts.

Second, we show that accounting for both macroeconomic trends leads to substantial
improvements in interest rate forecast accuracy relative to the usual
martingale benchmark at medium and long forecast horizons. Furthermore,
to achieve better forecasts, it is crucial to incorporate $r^\ast_t$ in the shifting
endpoint of nominal interest rates---including
only $\pi^\ast_t$ as a trend is insufficient. We document improvements in
forecast accuracy over the random walk and ``$\pi^\ast_t$-only''
alternatives that are both economically and statistically
significant. Also, our theoretical model
shows that such forecast improvements are a natural consequence
of the time series properties of inflation and the real short rate.

Third, accounting for a time-varying $r^\ast_t$ is important
for understanding return predictability and estimating bond risk
premia. Recently, CP used the connection between trend inflation
and interest rates to decompose the nominal yield curve into risk
premiums and the expectations hypothesis (EH) component (i.e., a term
that equals the average short-term interest rate that investors expect
to prevail during the life of a bond). They present strong evidence
for the predictive power of the inflation trend for excess bond returns,
which suggests that incorporating the inflation trend is important to
understand the risk premium/EH decomposition. Since $r^\ast_t$ plays
the same role of a persistent level factor for nominal interest rates
as does $\pi^\ast_t$, our theoretical model predicts that if $\pi^\ast_t$ has
predictive power for bond returns so should $r^\ast_t$. Hence, we
expand the analysis of CP by introducing shifts in the equilibrium
real interest rate into the analysis of risk premiums, and we do find a
strong incremental predictive power of $r^\ast_t$ for
bond returns. Therefore, measures of the bond risk premium as well as
empirical decompositions of long-term interest rates into expectations
and term premium components should incorporate both a
shifting $r^\ast_t$ and a shifting $\pi^\ast_t$.

As a fourth and final avenue of empirical examination, we compare the variance of the trend components of
inflation and real rates to the variance of interest rate changes
at different frequencies. \cite{duffee-inflation-risk} proposes using the ratio of the
variance of inflation news to the variance of innovations in nominal
interest rates as a useful empirical metric of the importance of inflation
in the determination of interest rates. He documents that for
one-quarter innovations, this ratio is small for U.S.~Treasury yields.
We generalize his measure to
consider variance ratios for longer $h$-period innovations, since the contributions to
interest rate variability may vary with frequency. This extension allows
us to measure, for example, the direct contribution of unexpected changes in
inflation over, say, the next five or ten years to the variance in nominal
bond yields. For quarterly changes, we find the low contribution
of inflation variability that was
reported by Duffee. But in line with our theoretical predictions, the
variance ratios increase substantially with the horizon. Although confidence
intervals are unavoidably wide, our estimates suggest that during the postwar
U.S.~sample, a large share of the interest rate variability faced by investors over long
holding periods was due to changes in the macroeconomic trend components of nominal
yields.

Overall, our paper provides strong empirical evidence of the
importance of macroeconomic trends---and for $r^\ast_t$ in
particular---for the nominal yield curve.\footnote{To be clear, our goal was
not to provide new estimates of $r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$, but
simply take the central tendencies of existing estimates from the
macroeconomics literature and consider whether these off-the-shelf
measures can provide evidence linking the inflation and real rate
trends to the yield curve and risk pricing. Presumably, a
  joint macro-finance estimation that produced tailor-made estimates
  of $r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$ would likely produce even a better
  fit for bond pricing and stronger results.}  Our consistent
empirical support linking inflation and real rate
trends to the yield curve and risk pricing have far-reaching implications
for modeling of interest rates and bond risk premia. Variations in
both the inflation trend and the
equilibrium real interest rate are quantitatively important. While the
former has been increasingly recognized, a time-varying $r^\ast_t$ has
been essentially ignored in yield curve analysis, which we argue is a
substantial oversight. Both structural
and reduced-form models of the yield curve need to allow for
slow-moving trend components in order to accurately capture interest
rate dynamics. In this way, shifting trends can be important for helping
researchers and practitioners assess the term premium in long-term
interest rates, forecast bond yields and returns, and understand the
drivers and historical evolution of the term structure of interest
rates.

Our paper relates to several strands of literature. A large literature
documents the importance of a trend component in the inflation
rate, notably \cite{kozicki-tinsley}, \cite{stock-watson-ucsv}, \cite{faust-wright},
and \cite{clark-doh}. The persistence in
the real interest rate is considered early on by \cite{rose} and was surveyed by
\cite{neely-rapach}. A related strand of literature investigates
the long-run Fisher effect, as in
\cite{mishkin92}. A more recent literature, originated by
\cite{laubach-williams}, uses macroeconomic and statistical models to
estimate the equilibrium real interest rate and to understand its
structural drivers (see the references in footnote
\ref{fn:rstar}). Our paper sheds a new light on these related strands
of literature by showing that the apparent trends in inflation and real
interest rates are not only consistent with the observed behavior of
the yield curve, but are in fact crucially important to understand this
behavior. Within the macro-finance literature on the
term structure of interest rates, some models have been proposed that
allow for changes in trend inflation; see \cite{htv}, \cite{rudebuschwu},
and \cite{bcm}. However these models generally assume a
constant equilibrium real rate. Finally, our long-horizon forecast
results are consistent with previous evidence, in
particular \cite{dijk-etal}, showing that it is important to allow for
time-varying endpoints when forecasting interest rates, but our
approach using the endpoint $i^\ast_t = \pi^\ast_t + r^\ast_t$
is both simpler and more accurate.

The paper is structured as follows: Section \ref{sec:model} introduces
a simple no-arbitrage model of the yield curve that allows for trend
components in inflation and the real rates, and derives testable
implications. Section \ref{sec:data} presents our empirical proxies
for $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$. In Section \ref{sec:cointegration} we
investigate the persistence of interest rates and the evidence for
cointegration. In Section \ref{sec:forecasting} we show the
improvements in forecast accuracy that are possible when accounting
for macroeconomic trends in interest rates. Section \ref{sec:returns}
documents the evidence for the incremental predictive power of
$\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$ for future excess bond returns. Section
\ref{sec:horizons} presents new estimates, using variance ratios, for
the role of inflation risk and macroeconomic trends at different
frequencies. Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes.

\section{A no-arbitrage model with macro trends}
\label{sec:model}

Our theoretical framework is a stylized affine term structure model
for real and nominal yields that demonstrates how, under absence of
arbitrage, changes in $\pi_t^\ast$ and $r_t^\ast$---the inflation
trend and the equilibrium real short rate---affect interest
rates. Although our framework is quite parsimonious---with few risk
factors, no stochastic volatility, and strong risk pricing
restrictions---it is sufficient to provide some important testable
predictions about fundamental aspects of the relationship between the
trend in inflation, the equilibrium real rate, and the yield
curve.\footnote{This specification generalizes the one in CP except to
  allow for time variation in $r^\ast_t$ and a flexible trend-cycle
  specification for inflation.}

We model inflation, $\pi_t$, as the sum of trend, cycle, and noise
components:
\[ \pi_{t+1} = \pi^\ast_t + c_t + e_{t+1}, \quad \pi^\ast_t =
\pi^\ast_{t-1} + \xi_t, \quad c_t = \phi_c c_{t-1} + u_t, \]
where the innovations $\xi_t$ and $u_t$ and the noise component $e_t$
are mutually independent \emph{iid} normal random variables with
standard deviations $\sigma_\xi$, $\sigma_u$ and $\sigma_e$. Inflation
expectations are $E_t \pi_{t+h+1} = \pi^\ast_t + \phi_c^h c_t$, and
$\underset{h \rightarrow \infty}{\lim} E_t \pi_{t+h}=\pi^\ast_t$ is
the time-varying inflation endpoint, which can be viewed as the perceived
inflation target of the central bank. This specification of the
inflation process is similar to the one in
\cite{duffee-inflation-risk} and is in line with the modern empirical
macro literature that allows for a trend component in inflation
\citep[a prominent example is][]{stock-watson-ucsv}. We assume that
the shocks $\xi_t$ and $u_t$ affect only expectations of future
inflation but not current inflation, which slightly simplifies the
bond pricing formulas but has no fundamental significance.

The one-period real rate, $r_t$, also has a trend
component, the equilibrium real rate $r_t^\ast$, and a stationary
component, the cyclical real-rate gap $g_t$:
\[ r_t = r^\ast_t + g_t, \quad r^\ast_t = r^\ast_{t-1} + \eta_t, \quad
g_t = \phi_g g_{t-1} + v_t. \]
The shocks are again mutually uncorrelated and \emph{iid} normal, with
standard deviations $\sigma_\eta$ and $\sigma_v$. Since
$\underset{h \rightarrow \infty}{\lim} E_t r_{t+h} = r_t^\ast$, the
equilibrium real rate can be understood
as the real rate that prevails in the economy after all shocks have
died out; see, for example, \cite{laubach-williams}. In the macroeconomics
literature, this endpoint is often called the neutral or natural rate of interest.

Formally, of course, this specification includes an exact unit root in
inflation and the real rate. We view this assumption merely as a convenient
way to model very persistent processes.  The use of unit roots
simplifies the exposition of our model and the arguments regarding
trend components, but it is not crucial.
Taken literally, a unit root specification is implausible because
the forecast error variances of inflation and real rates do not in fact increase
linearly with the forecast horizon as predicted by a unit root. Instead, both
variables have always remained within certain bounds.
However, in finite samples, a stationary process can always be approximated
arbitrarily well by a unit root process, and it is well-known that
doing so can often be beneficial for forecasting \citep[e.g.,][]{campbell-perron}.
Thus, $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$
can be viewed simply as highly persistent components of $\pi_t$ and
$r_t$, which capture expectations at the long horizons that are relevant in
practice for investors, even if infinite-horizon expectations are constant.

The final state variable determining interest rates is a risk price
factor $x_t$, which follows an independent autoregressive process:\footnote{\cite{cp05} provide evidence supporting a stationary single factor driving bond risk premiums. Also, see the discussion in CP.}
\[ x_t = \mu_x + \phi_x x_{t-1} + w_t, \]
where $v_t$ is \emph{iid} normal with standard deviation
$\sigma_w$. The state variables can be collected as
$Z_t = (\pi^\ast_t, c_t, r^\ast_t, g_t, x_t)'$, and their dynamics can
be compactly written as a VAR(1)
\begin{equation}
 Z_t = \mu + \phi Z_{t-1} + \Sigma \varepsilon_t, \label{eq:var}
\end{equation}
where $\mu = (0,0,0,0,\mu_x)'$, $\phi = diag(1,\phi_c,1,\phi_g, \phi_x)$,
$\Sigma = diag(\sigma_\xi, \sigma_u, \sigma_\eta, \sigma_v, \sigma_w)$,
and
$\varepsilon_t$ is a $(5 \times 1)$ \emph{iid} standard normal vector process.

The model is completed by a specification for the log real stochastic
discount factor (SDF), $m_{t+1}^r$, for which we choose the usual
essentially affine form of \cite{duffee02}:
\[ m_{t+1}^r = -r_t - \frac{1}{2} \lambda_t'\lambda_t -
\lambda_t'\varepsilon_{t+1}, \quad \lambda_t = \Sigma^{-1} (\lambda_0
+ \lambda_1 Z_t). \]
We only allow $x_t$ to affect the price of risk, so that the
first four columns of $\lambda_1$ are zero. Furthermore, shocks to
$x_t$ are not priced, so that the last element of $\lambda_0$ and the
last row of $\lambda_1$ are zero. The non-zero elements of $\lambda_0$
are denoted by $\lambda_{0\pi^\ast}, \lambda_{0c}, \lambda_{0 r^\ast},$ and
$\lambda_{0 g}$, and those of $\lambda_1$ by
$\lambda_{\pi^\ast x}, \lambda_{cx}, \lambda_{r^\ast x},$ and $\lambda_{g x}$.

The log nominal SDF is $m_{t+1}^n = m_{t+1}^r - \pi_{t+1}$, and the nominal
short-term interest rate is
\[ i_t = - E_t m_{t+1}^n - \frac{1}{2} Var_t (m_{t+1}^n) = r^\ast_t +
g_t + \pi^\ast_t +c_t - \frac{1}{2} \sigma_e^2. \]
Due to our timing assumption for the inflation process, and because
the noise shocks $e_t$ are not priced, there is no inflation risk
premium in the nominal short rate.\footnote{That is, $Cov_t(m_{t+1}^r,
  \pi_{t+1}) = 0$. CP make the same
  assumption, which is justified because estimates of this short-run inflation
  risk premium are typically very small. Note that the nominal
short rate equation can be related to the popular Taylor rule for monetary
policy in which $r^\ast_t + \pi^\ast_t$ represents the level of the policy-neutral
nominal short rate and $g_t + c_t$ captures the cyclical response of the
central bank.} Prices of
zero-coupon bonds with maturity $n$, denoted by $P_t^{(n)}$, are easily
verified to be exponentially affine, i.e., $\log(P_t^{(n)}) = A_n +
B_n'Z_t$, using the pricing equation $P_t^{(n+1)} =
E_t(\exp(m_{t+1}^n)P_{t+1}^{(n)})$. The
coefficients follow the usual recursions of affine term structure models \citep[e.g.,][]{angpiazzesi}:
\[ A_{n+1} = A_n + B_n' (\mu - \lambda_0) + C_n, \quad C_n :=
\frac{1}{2} (\sigma_e^2 + B_n' \Sigma \Sigma' B_n), \quad B_{n+1} =
-(1,1,1,1,0)' + (\phi - \lambda_1)'B_n, \] where $C_n$ captures the
convexity in bond prices. The initial conditions are
$A_0=0, B_0 = (0,0,0,0,0)'$. For the individual loadings of bond prices on the risk
factors we have
\[ B_{n+1}^{\pi^\ast} = B_{n}^{\pi^\ast} - 1, \quad B_{n+1}^c = \phi_c
B_n^c -1, \quad B_{n+1}^{r^\ast} =
B_n^{r^\ast} - 1, \quad B_{n+1}^g = \phi_g B_n^g - 1,\]
\[ B_{n+1}^x = -\lambda_{\pi^\ast x} B_n^{\pi^\ast} -\lambda_{cx}
B_n^c - \lambda_{r^\ast x} B_n^{r^\ast} - \lambda_{gx} B_n^g + \phi_x
B_n^x, \] and the explicit solutions are
\begin{gather*}
 B_n^{\pi^\ast} = -n, \quad B_n^c = \frac{\phi^n_c -
  1}{1-\phi_c},\quad B_n^{r^\ast} = -n, \quad B_n^g = \frac{\phi^n_g -
  1}{1-\phi_g},\\
B_n^x = \frac{\lambda_{\pi^\ast x} +
\lambda_{r^\ast x}}{1-\phi_x}\left(n - \frac{1-\phi_x^n}{1-\phi_x}\right)
+ \frac{\lambda_{cx}}{1-\phi_c}\left( \frac{1-\phi_x^n}{1-\phi_x} -
  \frac{\phi_x^n - \phi_c^n}{\phi_x - \phi_c} \right)
+ \frac{\lambda_{gx}}{1-\phi_g}\left( \frac{1-\phi_x^n}{1-\phi_x} -
  \frac{\phi_x^n - \phi_g^n}{\phi_x - \phi_g} \right).
\end{gather*}
For nominal bond yields the model implies the following decomposition:
\begin{eqnarray}
y_t^{(n)} &=& -\log(P_t^{(n)})/n = -A_n/n - B_n'Z_t/n \nonumber \\
&=&  \underbrace{\pi_t^\ast + \frac{1-\phi_c^n}{n(1-\phi_c)}
    c_t}_{\sum_{i=1}^n E_t \pi_{t+i}/n} +
    \underbrace{r_t^\ast + \frac{1-\phi_g^n}{n(1-\phi_g)}
    g_t}_{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} E_t r_{t+i}/n} \quad \underbrace{ -A_n/n
    - B_n^x x_t/n.}_{\text{convexity and yield term premium}} \label{eq:yields}
\end{eqnarray}
Equation \eqref{eq:yields} clearly shows the role of the trend and
cyclical components of inflation and real rates, and of the
risk-premium factor, for interest rates at different maturities. The
trend components $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$ naturally act as level
factors by affecting yields of all maturities equally.\footnote{The
  constant loadings of yields on the trend variables shows that unit
  roots are also present under the risk-neutral measure.  Strictly
  speaking, this is inconsistent with absence of arbitrage---see
  \cite{dybvig-ingersoll-ross} and
  \citet[][p.~433]{campbell-lo-mackinlay}---because the convexity in
  $-A_n/n$ diverges to minus infinity. However, as in the case of the
  real-world measure, our predictions are unaffected if the largest
  roots under the risk-neutral measure are taken to be very close to
  but below one.} The cyclical components $c_t$ and $g_t$ are slope
factors as they affect short-term yields more strongly than long-term
yields, and their loadings approach zero for large $n$. The risk-premium
factor affects long-term yields more strongly than short-term yields:
The loadings of yields on $x_t$ start at zero and tend to
$\underset{n \rightarrow \infty}{\lim} -B_x^n/n = -(\lambda_{\pi^\ast
  x} + \lambda_{r^\ast x})/(1-\phi_x)$.  Thus, long-term interest
rates are mostly driven by the trend components $\pi^\ast_t$ and
$r^\ast_t$, as well as by the risk-premium factor
$x_t$. They are affected to a much lesser degree than short-term
yields by the cyclical factors $c_t$ and $g_t$. Appendix
\ref{app:dtsm} provides additional details and results for this affine
model, including expressions for forward rates. In our empirical
analysis we will focus on long-term (five-year and ten-year) yields as
well as long-term (five-to-ten-year) forward rates to exhibit
the importance of $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$.

The model implies several predictions about the relationship between
interest rates and the two macroeconomic trends. However, these
predictions will be evident in the data only to the
extent that there is material variation in the trend
components. Furthermore, an empirical assessment requires accurate
estimates of $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$ (in Section
\ref{sec:data} we describe our empirical proxies). Thus, our empirical
analysis should be viewed as tests of the joint hypothesis that (a) the behavior of the trend
components and their links to the yield curve conform to our
no-arbitrage model, (b) variation in the trend components is
quantitatively important, and (c) our empirical proxies accurately
capture the evolution of the trend components.

A first straightforward prediction of the model is that for any yield
maturity $n$, the detrended yield $y_t^{(n)} - \pi^\ast_t - r^\ast_t$
will be much less persistent than the yield itself. The difference in
persistence is particularly pronounced for long-term yields or forward rates,
which place a heavy weight on the trend components. Strictly speaking,
under the unit root specification, $y_t^{(n)}$ is I(1) while
$y_t^{(n)} - \pi^\ast_t - r^\ast_t$ is I(0). Furthermore, a regression
of $y_t^{(n)}$ on $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$ is a cointegrating
regression that should recover unit coefficients, since the cointegrating
vector of $(y_t^{(n)}, \pi^\ast_t, r^\ast_t)$ is $(1, -1, -1)$.
The model also predicts that a partial detrending with only the inflation
trend will be much less successful. Namely, $y_t^{(n)} - \pi^\ast_t$
will exhibit substantial persistence. Similarly, a regression of
$y_t^{(n)}$ on $\pi^\ast_t$ is a spurious regression that will not
recover a unit coefficient and will produce residuals that remain highly
persistent. We will investigate these predictions empirically in Section
\ref{sec:cointegration}.

The fact that interest rates do not have a constant mean but contain the
stochastic trend $i^\ast_t = \pi^\ast_t + r^\ast_t$ also has important
implications for yield forecasts. From \eqref{eq:var} and
\eqref{eq:yields} we have
\[ \underset{h
  \rightarrow \infty}{\lim} E_t y^{(n)}_{t+h} = \text{constant} +
\pi^\ast_t + r^\ast_t,
\]
so interest rates mean-revert to a ``shifting endpoint''
\citep{kozicki-tinsley} that is driven by $i^\ast_t$. Note that in principle
the value of the constant depends on the maturity $n$, but in practice,
this dependence is
sufficiently small that it can be neglected. The model predicts that long-horizon interest
rate forecasts that incorporate knowledge of $i^\ast_t$ are more
accurate than forecasts that ignore it. In particular, long-range
forecasts that account for $i^\ast_t$ should improve upon the common
forecast benchmark of a random walk. We will examine these forecast performance
issues in Section \ref{sec:forecasting}.

A third area in which macro trends may be empirically relevant is for the
prediction of excess bond returns. CP report substantial gains in such
prediction from including their measure of
trend inflation. In our model, as in the CP model, excess
bond returns, $rx_{t+1}^{(n)}$, are driven only by the risk premium factor $x_t$:
\[rx_{t+1}^{(n)} = p_{t+1}^{(n-1)} - p_t^{(n)} - y_t^{(1)}
= - \frac{1}{2} B_{n-1}' \Sigma \Sigma' B_{n-1} + B_{n-1}'(\lambda_0 +
\lambda_1 \iota_5)x_t + B_{n-1}'\Sigma \varepsilon_{t+1}, \]
where $p^{(n)}_t$ denotes the log-price of a zero-coupon bond with maturity
of $n$ quarters and $\iota_5$ is a $(5 \times 1)$-vector of ones. The better
performance found by CP in predicting excess bond returns with trend inflation
suggests that accounting for the trend component helps to identify
information about expected returns (i.e., the risk-premium factor)
that is contained in observed interest rates. However, according to our model, the
equilibrium real rate can drive nominal yields in the same fashion as
the trend component of inflation. Therefore, our model's prediction is
that including not only $\pi^\ast_t$ but also
$r^\ast_t$ should improve the ability of predictive regressions to
capture variation in bond risk premia. We assess the role of both trend
components for return predictability in Section \ref{sec:returns}.

Finally, the model predicts that macroeconomic trends should play a
particularly important role in accounting for interest rate changes
at low frequencies. The trend components are highly
persistent, so while their influence can be obscured by transitory
volatility at higher frequencies (e.g., quarterly changes), they should
key drivers of interest rate changes over longer intervals (e.g., over a
decade or more). This pattern implies that variance ratios of changes in the trend
components relative to changes in interest rates should exhibit a
pronounced tendency to rise with the period of the change. In Section
\ref{sec:horizons} we will use such variance
ratios to estimate the importance of the
trend components at different frequencies.

\section{Data and trend estimates}
\label{sec:data}

We now describe the data used in our investigation of the
relation between long-term interest rates and macroeconomic
trends. Our data set is quarterly and extends from 1971:Q4 to
2015:Q4. The interest rate data are the zero-coupon Treasury
yields from \cite{gsw} with maturities from one to 15 years. We
augment these data with three- and six-month Treasury bill rates from the Federal Reserve's
H.15 data. We use end-of-quarter interest rates.

%GR:I think we cover the below in the intro enough and this objective may seem simplistic.
%The ten-year yield is plotted in Figure
%\ref{fig:data1}. It exhibits the well-known pattern of a
%pronounced increase over the 1970s with a spike in the early 1980s,
%and a more or less continuous decrease over the following three
%decades. To explain this secular downward trend is an important
%objective of our paper.

For measuring trend inflation, $\pi^\ast_t$, several different
methods are available including surveys, statistical
models, or a combination of the two---see, for example,
\cite{stock-watson-2015} and the references therein. We
employ a well-known survey-based measure, namely, the Federal Reserve's
research series on the \underline{p}erceived inflation \underline{t}arget
\underline{r}ate, denoted PTR. PTR
measures long-run expectations of inflation in the price index of
personal consumption expenditure (PCE), and is often used in empirical
work---see, for example, \cite{clark-mccracken}. Since 1979 (i.e., for most of
our sample) PTR is based exclusively on survey expectations.\footnote{Before 1979
  PTR is based on estimates from the learning model for expected
  inflation of \cite{kozicki-tinsley}. For details on the construction of PTR, see
  \cite{brayton-tinsley}. PTR can be downloaded with the updates of
  the Federal Reserve's FRB/US large-scale macroeconomic model at
  \url{https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/frbus/us-models-package.htm}.}
Figure \ref{fig:data1} shows that from the beginning of our sample to
the late 1990s, this estimate mostly mirrored the increase and
decrease in the ten-year yield. Since then, however, it has been
essentially flat at the level of two percent, which in 2012 was
announced as the long-run inflation target of the FOMC. Other survey
expectations of inflation over the long run, such as the long-range
forecasts in the Blue Chip survey, exhibit a similar pattern. The inflation trend
CP use is a simple weighted moving average of past core inflation, which
as they note co-moves closely with PTR.

Estimation of the equilibrium real interest rate, $r_t^\ast$, is more
challenging, but recently, the literature on the estimation of $r^\ast_t$
has grown rapidly.\footnote{Alternative survey-based estimates of $r_t^\ast$
would require long-run expectations of both nominal interest rates and
inflation. Unfortunately, the available time span for the former
is quite limited (the earliest is a biannual Blue Chip Financial Forecasts
series that starts in 1986). In addition, long-range survey forecasts
of nominal interest rates also tend to be
less accurate than forecasts of inflation \citep[see, for example][]{dijk-etal}.}
These estimates invariably rely on models with macroeconomic structural
underpinnings and macroeconomic data. A popular example is the model of
\cite{laubach-williams}, in which the unobserved natural rate is inferred from
macroeconomic data using the Kalman filter. In Figure
\ref{fig:data2}, we plot the one-sided/filtered Laubach-Williams
estimate of $r_t^\ast$.\footnote{This filtered estimate is obtained
  using only past and contemporaneous information, whereas the
  two-sided/smoothed estimate incorporates information from the
  whole sample. Note, however, that both estimates are conditional
  upon estimates of the model parameters which are obtained using the
  full sample.} In addition, the figure also includes the estimates of
\cite{lubik-mathes}, who employ a time-varying parameter VAR model,
\cite{kiley}, who augments the Laubach-Williams model with credit spreads,
and \cite{johannsen-mertens}, who adjust a VAR
model to account for the lower bound on nominal interest rates. Figure
\ref{fig:data2} shows that since the early 1980s, these four estimates evolve in a
broadly similar fashion. A simple but effective way to smooth across
the various specific modeling approaches and aggregate the information
into one indicator is to take the average of the four estimates.
In the 1970s, 80s, and 90s, this average fluctuated modestly between 2 and 3
percent, which is consistent with the received wisdom of that era that
viewed the equilibrium real rate as effectively constant. However, from
2000 to 2015, all of the measures fall, with an average decline of 2.3
percentage points.

Together the survey-based $\pi^\ast_t$ and the average macro-based
$r^\ast_t$ tell the compelling story about the evolution of long-term nominal
interest rates shown in Figure \ref{fig:data1}. Starting with the Volcker
disinflation of the 1980s, interest rates and inflation
trended down together. Around the turn of the
millennium, long-run inflation expectations stabilized near 2
percent. However, long-term interest rates continued to decline, in part,
according to the average $r_t^\ast$ measure, because structural changes
in the global economy started pushing down the equilibrium real rate.
These structural changes may include slowdowns in trend growth in various
countries, increases in desired saving due to demographic forces and a
greater preference toward higher saving by emerging market economies, and
declines in desired investment spending in part reflecting a fall in the
relative price of capital goods \citep[see, for example][]{rachel-smith}.

In our analysis below, we employ these measures of $r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$ in a variety of empirical settings to illustrate their importance for accounting for the dynamics of yield curves and bond returns. That is, we simply consider whether the existing survey- and macro-based off-the-shelf estimates can provide evidence linking the inflation and real rate trends to the yield curve and risk pricing.\footnote{This is similar in spirit to the methodology of CP, but we include $r^\ast_t$ as well as $\pi^\ast_t$ and greatly enlarge the scope of the empirical term structure analysis.} An alternative and complementary strategy would be to estimate time-varying $r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$ within a no-arbitrage term structure model. This would provide a powerful integrated estimation of trends and risk pricing.  While such an strategy has advantages, our current approach, which conditions on existing, external estimates, can provide a key external validation of the importance of trends for yield curve analysis. In particular, the fact that our off-the-shelf measures of $r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$ have not been fine-tuned to incorporate no-arbitrage theoretical restrictions or fitted to particular risk pricing dynamics arguably makes any evidence we do find, say, of improvements in forecasting expected returns in Treasury bonds, even more impressive. We take this somewhat conservative approach to incorporating survey- and macro-based trends as an initial step in establishing the importance of $\pi^\ast_t$ and especially $r^\ast_t$ for the term structure of interest rates.

\section{Persistence in long-term yields from $r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$} % and cointegration}
\label{sec:cointegration}

If the trend components of inflation and the real interest rate play
an important role in driving interest rates, then these trends should
exhibit a close statistical relationship with long-term interest rates
and account for most of their persistence. A natural starting point
for assessing this relationship is to consider simple regressions of
yields on measures of the trend components. Table \ref{tab:reg}
reports the results for such regressions with three different
dependent variables: bond yields with 5 and 10 years maturity, and the
5-to-10-year forward rate. For each maturity, we estimate two versions
of the regressions (with standard errors calculated using the
Newey-West estimator with six lags). The first version has only a
constant and $\pi^\ast_t$ as regressors, which is the same regression
that CP estimated using their simple moving-average estimate of the
inflation trend (see their table 1). These regression results confirm the
findings of CP, namely, high $R^2$'s at all maturities and
$\pi^\ast_t$ coefficients that are just above one and highly
significant.\footnote{Our estimated coefficients on $\pi^\ast_t$ are
  somewhat higher than in CP because our measure of the inflation
  trend is less variable, though when $r^\ast_t$ is added, the
  estimated coefficients for $\pi^\ast_t$ decrease toward one.} CP
interpret these results as indicating that trend inflation drives the
level of yield curve; however, the second regression adds
$r^\ast_t$ as a regressor. These second regression results show
that incorporating a trend real rate is also important. With the
addition of $r^\ast_t$ to each of the regressions, both trend
coefficients are highly significant, and the regression $R^2$'s
increase further by between 8 and 13 percentage points.

Taken at face value, these estimates suggest that changes in
$r^\ast_t$ along with changes in $\pi^\ast_t$, are key sources of
variation in long-term interest rates.
However, the interpretation of these results is complicated by the fact
that all of the variables in the regressions are highly
persistent. Conventional asymptotic arguments, which justify inference
based on the Newey-West standard errors and $R^2$'s in Table \ref{tab:reg},
are not valid if some of the variables contain
autoregressive roots close to or equal to one. For example, under the assumptions
of the model in Section \ref{sec:model}, the static regressions
estimate the cointegrating relationships between long-term interest
rates, inflation, and real rates.\footnote{Much empirical work, for example, \cite{kpsw},
has documented the substantial persistence in nominal interest rates,
inflation, and real interest rates. The main difference between
our static regressions and the usual cointegration regressions in this
context \citep[as in][for example]{rose} is that we use directly observable
proxies for the trend components of $\pi_t$ and $r_t$.} If there is a
cointegrating relationship among the variables of such a regression, then the
regression provides super-consistent estimates of the cointegrating
vector, the $R^2$ converges to one, and conventional
hypothesis tests are likely invalid for inference about the
coefficients \citep[e.g.,][Chapter 19]{hamilton}. Consequently, the
regression results in Table \ref{tab:reg}---although suggestive of the
joint importance of $r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$ for the determination
of yields---cannot provide definitive answers.

As a first step to provide more compelling statistical evidence that
our measures of $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$ capture the persistent
variation in interest rates, we compare the time series properties of long-term
interest rates with no detrending to the series with one or both of the trend
components subtracted out. For the same three interest rates considered above,
Table \ref{tab:detrended} includes both simple differences as the
detrended series, that is, assuming unit coefficients on $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$,
as well as the residuals from the static regressions in Table \ref{tab:reg}.
For each series, Table \ref{tab:detrended} reports the standard deviation and two measures of
persistence: the estimated first-order autocorrelation coefficient,
$\hat{\rho}$, and the half-life, which
indicates the number of quarters until half of a given shock has died
out and is calculated as $\ln(0.5)/\ln(\hat{\rho})$.
Several findings stand out: First, detrending with $r^\ast_t$ as well as
$\pi^\ast_t$ accounts for noticeably more persistence, typically
reducing the half-life by about 40-50\%. That is, $\pi^\ast_t$ is
not the only important driver of interest rate persistence. Second, the detrended series are
substantially less variable and less persistent than the original
interest rate series. For example, shocks to the ten-year yield have a
half-life of about 5-1/2 years, whereas shocks to the series that is
the difference of this yield and the trend components have a half-life
of only 1-1/4 years. Finally, there is little difference in the statistical
properties between the series that are detrended using unit
coefficients and those that are detrended using estimated
coefficients, in particular for the forward rate.

Unit root tests provide further evidence supporting the detrending with both $r^\ast_t$
and $\pi^\ast_t$. We calculate parametric Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) $t$-statistics
and non-parametric Phillips-Perron (PP) $Z_\alpha$ statistics to examine
the persistence properties of these series by testing
the null hypothesis of a unit autoregressive root.\footnote{For the ADF
test, we include a constant and $k$ lagged difference in the test
regression, where $k$ is determined using the general-to-specific procedure
suggested by \cite{ng-perron-95}. We start with $k=4$ quarterly lags and
reduce the number of lags until the coefficient on the last lag is
significant at the ten percent level. For the PP test, we use a
Newey-West estimator of the long-run variance with four lags.
When the series under consideration is a residual from
an estimated cointegration regression, we don't include intercepts in
the ADF or PP regression equations and use the critical values provided by
\cite{phillips-ouliaris}, which depend on the number of regressors in
the cointegration equation.} These tests show strong evidence against the
unit root null for the series that are detrended with both
$\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$. By contrast, the unit root null is never rejected
at the 10 percent level for the original interest rate series or for
series that are detrended by only $\pi^\ast_t$. This supports the use of
both the $r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$ trends for accounting for interest rate
persistence and for understanding interest rate dynamics. Finally, with
the exception of the five-year yield, the rejections are equally
strong or stronger for the series that are detrended using unit
coefficients as for the residuals from the static regressions.

The long-run Fisher effect posits a common trend of inflation and
interest rates, with a unit coefficient (leaving aside tax
considerations). A sizeable literature has tested this hypothesis with
mixed results, a common finding being a coefficient on inflation that
is less than one.\footnote{Prominent examples include
  \cite{mishkin92}, \cite{wallace-warner}, and \cite{evans-lewis}.}
We have provided evidence that long-term interest rates contain two
trend components but that the series
$y_t - \pi^\ast_t - r^\ast_t$ is stationary, consistent
with the prediction of our model. Our results thus provide strong
support for a long-run Fisher effect, but show that one needs to
account for shifts in the equilibrium real rate to uncover it.
The importance of time variation
in $r^\ast_t$ explains why past research has generally been unable to
find a stable relationship between nominal interest rates
and inflation, going back to \cite{rose} and recently summarized by
\cite{neely-rapach}. Ignoring $r_t^\ast$ as a trend component---for example by
estimating a bivariate cointegration relation between $y_t$ and
$\pi^\ast_t$ (or $\pi_t$)---makes it very difficult to see the Fisher
effect. Using our proxies for the trend components in inflation and
real rates, we obtain clear, unambiguous results: the trends
components of inflation and the real rate are related to interest
rates exactly as standard finance theory predicts. These two trends
together capture a large share of the persistence in long-term
interest rates.

\section{Forecasting interest rates with $r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$}
\label{sec:forecasting}

%Specifically,
%our long-horizon forecast exercise confirms that interest rates
%exhibit reversion to a time-varying mean or endpoint, which, in line
%with the theory of Section \ref{sec:model}, equals $i^\ast_t = \pi^\ast_t +
%r^\ast_t$.\footnote{The model in Section \ref{sec:model} implies that
%  the endpoint equals a maturity-specific constant plus $i^\ast_t$,
%  but our results show that it is not necessary to try to estimate and
%  include this constant in the endpoint to obtain accurate forecasts.}
%Our results also show that accounting only
%for the variation in $\pi^\ast_t$ is insufficient, and that information
%in $r^\ast_t$ needs to be taken into account.

The previous section illustrated the strong persistence of interest rates and
the close link between that persistence and measures of the inflation trend,
$\pi^\ast_t$, and the equilibrium real rate, $r^\ast_t$. Here, we provide
complementary evidence based on interest rate forecasts.

We forecast the five-year
and ten-year yields, and the five-to-ten-year forward rate. At each
point in time $t$, starting at $t=20$ when five years of data are
available, we forecast each interest rate, $y_t$, at horizons from $h=1$
to $h=40$ quarters. The benchmark model in the literature is a
driftless random walk, i.e., the forecast
$\hat{y}_{t+h} = y_t$ for all $h$. This benchmark is included in the
results as Method 1. We consider two alternative
forecast specifications that assume that interest rates mean-revert to a
time-varying endpoint $\hat{\imath}_t$. Method 2 assumes that this
endpoint is only driven by the inflation trend, i.e., that
$\hat{\imath}_t$ equals $\pi^\ast_t$ plus a constant. We estimate this
constant recursively as the mean of $y_\tau - \pi^\ast_\tau$, using
observations from $\tau=1$ to $\tau=t$.\footnote{We have found in
  additional, unreported results that forecasts which assume that this
  constant is zero perform much worse than this method.} Method 3
instead assumes that the endpoint is
$\hat{\imath}_t = i^\ast_t = \pi^\ast_t + r^\ast_t$. For both forecast methods, the
speed of mean-reversion is recursively estimated as the first-order
autocorrelation coefficient of $y_t - \hat{\imath}_t$. Denoting this
coefficient as $\hat{\rho}_t$ the forecasts for methods 2 and 3 are
constructed as
$\hat{y}_{t+h} = \hat{\rho}_t^h y_t + (1-\hat{\rho}_t^h) \hat{\imath}_t$.
The exact value of $\hat{\rho}_t$ or even the methodology for determining
it had no effect on our main results but only affects short-horizon forecasts.

Table \ref{tab:yield_forecasts} reports the results of this
forecasting exercise in terms of root-mean-squared errors (RMSEs) and
mean-absolute errors (MAEs), in percentage points. We also calculate
$p$-values for tests of equal finite-sample forecast accuracy
using the approach of \cite{diebold-mariano} (DM).\footnote{Following
common use, we construct the DM test with a rectangular window
for the long-run variance and the small-sample adjustment of
\cite{harvey-leybourne-newbold}. Monte Carlo evidence in
  \cite{clark-mccracken} indicates that this test has good size in finite
  samples. However, for very long forecast horizons there are of
  course only few non-overlapping observations in our sample, so the
  $p$-values are subject to substantial uncertainty.} We calculate these DM
$p$-values, using standard normal critical values, for
one-sided tests of whether forecasts using the endpoint $\pi^\ast_t +
r^\ast_t$ (method 3) improve upon random walk forecasts (method 1) and forecasts that use
only $\pi^\ast_t$ for the endpoint (method 2). We find that method 3
leads to gains in forecast accuracy at long horizons that are both
substantial and highly significant. Such gains are present for both
RMSEs and MAEs, but are larger and more strongly significant for
absolute-error loss. For example, when forecasting the ten-year yield
five years ahead, using the information in $\pi^\ast_t+r^\ast_t$ decreases the RMSE by over 25\%
relative to the random walk forecast, an improvement that is
significant at the five-percent level, while the MAE is decreased by
more than 40\% with significance at the one percent level. This
forecast method also improves upon method 2, which does not use the
information in $r^\ast_t$, and the improvement is typically large and
statistically significant.

This long-horizon forecast exercise thus confirms that interest rates
exhibit reversion to a time-varying endpoint of $i^\ast_t = \pi^\ast_t +
r^\ast_t$. This result is consistent with the theory of Section
\ref{sec:model}\footnote{The model in Section \ref{sec:model} implies that
  the endpoint equals a maturity-specific constant plus $i^\ast_t$,
  but our results show that it is not necessary to try to estimate and
  include this constant in the endpoint to obtain accurate forecasts.}
Earlier authors, such as \cite{dijk-etal}, have found
that when forecasting interest rates it is beneficial to link long-run
projections of interest rates to long-run expectations of
inflation. Our new result shows that including $r^\ast_t$ along
with $\pi^\ast_t$ improves on long-horizon interest rate
forecasting to an even greater degree. That is, accounting only
for the variation in $\pi^\ast_t$ is insufficient, and it is important
to account for time variation in $r^\ast_t$ in understanding
yield curve dynamics. Furthermore, while earlier
authors run regressions of the
level of interest rates on long-run inflation expectations, we have
shown that no scaling or estimation is necessary for accurate long-range
forecasts if the endpoint is simply taken as $\pi^\ast_t +
r^\ast_t$.\footnote{Our approach could easily be extended to jointly forecast the
whole yield curve as in \cite{diebold-li} and \cite{dijk-etal}, by simply forecasting the
Nelson-Siegel level factor in the same fashion that we have forecast
each individual interest rate above.}

Many studies have documented that it is difficult to beat the random
walk model when forecasting interest rates.\footnote{Prominent
  examples include \cite{duffee02} and \cite{diebold-li}; see
  \cite{duffee-handbook-forecasting} for a review of this
  literature.} This is of
course due to the extreme persistence of interest rates. But our
results show that one can obtain better forecasts if one accounts for
the source of this persistence. The
use of our empirical proxies for the macroeconomic trends inherent in
interest rates leads to substantially better long-term forecasts than
the random walk model. This finding does not imply that either
interest rates or their trend components are truly I(1) time series, but
instead reflect the fact that when forecasting highly persistent but
possibly stationary series, it often helps predictive accuracy to
model such series as containing a unit root.

\section{Predicting bond returns with $r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$}
\label{sec:returns}

We now turn to the role of macroeconomic trends in predicting bond
returns. In the analysis of CP, proxies for the
inflation trend have significant predictive power for annual
excess bond returns, above and beyond the information contained in the
yield curve itself. Since $r^\ast_t$ also is an important trend
driving long-term interest rates, we address the natural related
question of what role it plays in such predictive regressions.

We predict excess returns for holding periods of one quarter and four
quarters. The excess return for a holding period of $h$ quarters for
a bond with maturity $n$ is calculated as
\[
  rx_{t, t+h}^{(n)} = p_{t+h}^{(n-h)} - p_t^{(n)} - h y_t^{(h)} =
  -(n-h)y_{t+h}^{(n-h)} + n y_t^{(n)} - h y_t^{(h)}.
\]
Our long-term bond yields are available only at annual maturities, so
we calculate one-quarter returns with the usual approximation
$y_{t+1}^{(n-1)} \approx y_{t+1}^{(n)}$. Our dependent variable is the
average excess return for all bonds with two to 15 years
maturity.\footnote{CP focused on annual holding periods and used
a weighted average that downweights
  longer-term bonds. Our use of a simple average made no material
  difference to the results and is more common in
  this literature. Our sample period is similar to
  the one considered in CP but extends to 2015---several year further.}
We estimate three specifications of the predictive
regressions: The first includes a constant and the first three
principal components (PCs) of yields. This common baseline regression
is motivated by work going back to \cite{famabliss} and
\cite{campbellshiller91} which showed that there is information in the
yield curve itself, and in particular in its slope (PC2), about
expected bond returns. The second specification adds $\pi^\ast_t$ and
is closely related to the specifications including an inflation trend
that were estimated by CP. The third specification also includes
$r^\ast_t$, in order to simultaneously capture the effects of both macroeconomic trends
in the regression.

The top panel of Table \ref{tab:returns} reports the estimation
results for the full sample. We calculate White's heteroskedasticity-robust standard
errors for the case of one-quarter returns and Newey-West
standard errors with six lags for the four-quarter returns (since
the overlap introduces serial correlations in the error term). Our
results replicate CP's main finding, namely that inclusion
of the inflation trend raises the predictive power quite substantially
compared to a regression that only includes yield-curve
information, and that both the inflation trend and the level of yields
(PC1) appear highly significant. However, adding $r^\ast_t$ to the regression leads to impressive
further gains in predictive power. For both one-quarter and
four-quarter returns, the $R^2$ increases substantially, the
coefficients and $t$-statistics for $\pi^\ast_t$ and PC1 rise, and the
coefficient on $r^\ast_t$ itself is large and highly significant.
Interestingly, the coefficient on $r^\ast_t$ is about as large as
the coefficient on $\pi^\ast_t$, which confirms the prediction
from our theoretical model that these two trends play roles
of similar magnitude in determining interest rates.

It is well known that predictive regressions for bond returns raise
some knotty econometric issues. \cite{bauer-hamilton} show that the
small-sample inference is particularly problematic when the predictors are highly
persistent, like interest rates and our macro trends. They propose a
parametric bootstrap procedure to carry out robust
inference in such cases. It tests the null
hypothesis that only the information in the yield curve is
useful for predicting excess returns, and it can accurately
gauge the statistical significance of additional proposed
predictors. We follow their recommendation and calculate bootstrap
small-sample $p$-values for the coefficients on $\pi^\ast_t$ and
$r^\ast_t$. Our bootstrap simulates yields from a simple
VAR(1) factor model and the additional predictors from a separate
VAR(1) model, so that the null hypothesis holds by construction. The
predictive regression is estimated in each bootstrap sample and the
$t$-statistics for the additional predictors are recorded. With this
small-sample distribution of the test statistics in hand, $p$-values
are calculated as the fraction of simulated samples in
which the $t$-statistic is at least as large (in absolute value) as
the $t$-statistic in the actual data. These $p$-values, reported in
squared brackets in Table \ref{tab:returns}, indicate that both of our
trends are statistically significant even when we account for
small-sample econometric concerns.

According to the small-sample $p$-values, in the subsample starting in
1985, the inflation trend is not statistically significant when
included on its own.\footnote{This is consistent with \cite{bauer-hamilton}
  who also found that in a subsample starting in 1985 the inflation trend is only
  marginally significant.}  Only when we add our measure of the equilibrium real
rate, do both trends matter for bond risk premia; the coefficients on
$\pi^\ast_t$ and PC1 more than double, the $R^2$ increases
substantially, and the coefficients on $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$ are
statistically significant. These results confirm our intuition from
Figure \ref{fig:data1} that the real-rate trend has gained in
importance and significance over time as it has exhibited a pronounced
decline over the past twenty years while the trend in inflation has
been essentially constant. Therefore, empirical analysis of long-term
interest rates during that period implies that the trend in the real
interest rate is at least as important as, and recently more important
than, the trend in inflation.\footnote{In additional, unreported
  results we have found that the predictive gains from including
  $r^\ast_t$ are particularly large during the early 2000s when both
  $r^\ast_t$ and long-term interest rates decreased while long-run
  inflation expectations where anchored close to two percent.}

An important contribution of CP is that they estimated ``interest rate
cycles,'' defined as the de-trended or cyclical component in interest
rates, and showed that these cycles captured the predictive power in
interest rates and the inflation trend for future bond returns. They
estimated the interest rate cycles as the residuals of regressions of
interest rates on their measure of the inflation trend. Our
results here and in the previous sections indicate that a better
estimate of the cycle is obtained by incorporating measures of both an
inflation trend and a real rate trend. If the cycle is simply
calculated as the difference between an interest rate and trend
inflation (or as a residual), this purported cycle will still contain
an important trend component due to changes in the equilibrium real
interest rate. Furthermore, our results suggest that a simple
difference between a long-term interest rate and
$i^\ast_t = \pi^\ast_t + r^\ast_t$ is likely sufficient; there is no
need to run a regression to construct interest rate cycles. Such
estimates of interest rate cycles could, for example, be used to
construct a return-forecasting factor, as in CP, that would better
account for the trend components and the variation in bond risk
premia

An outstanding issue is why
information in $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$ is not spanned by the yield
curve. Unspanned risks in bond returns are an important current issue
in macro-finance; see \cite{duffee-handbook-forecasting}, \cite{jls}, \cite{jps}, and \cite{bauer-hamilton}.
CP and \cite{bauer-rudebusch-spanning} argue the lack of spanning reflects
measurement errors in yields, but there may be other, more
structural reasons. The incremental predictive power of macro trends and
the apparent failure of the spanning hypothesis may reflect some
underlying economic mechanisms related to the unobservable nature of trends. [Clark and Kozicki real-time issues]

In sum, accounting for the persistent components of yields is
important for understanding return predictability and estimation of
bond risk premia. We find that $r^\ast_t$ has strong incremental
predictive power for bond returns, about on par with the importance of
$\pi^\ast_t$ as a predictor, suggesting that in this context it is
important to account for not only the inflation trend but also estimates of the
equilibrium real rate.

\section{Variance contributions of $r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$}
\label{sec:horizons}

Finally, we directly compare the size of fluctuations in
$r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$ with those of long-term nominal
bond yields. Using variance ratios for quarterly innovations in bond yields,
\cite{duffee-inflation-risk} finds news about future inflation is small
relative to the variation of quarterly innovations to nominal bond yields.
We interpret his results in the context of our model and extend them
to consider movements in both $r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$ and
at horizons greater than just one quarter.

The variance ratio used by Duffee divides the variance of innovations to average inflation
expectations over $n$ periods by the variance of innovations to the
bond yield for maturity $n$:
\[ VR_1^{(n)} = \frac{Var\left((E_t-E_{t-1})n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n
  \pi_{t+i}\right)}{Var\left((E_t-E_{t-1}) y_t^{(n)}\right)},
\]
This ratio compares one-period changes in expected average
future inflation to the one-period surprise in a bond yield.
We generalize this variance ratio to consider
a longer time span to measure the change in expectations,
\[
  VR_h^{(n)} = \frac{Var\left((E_t-E_{t-h})n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n
    \pi_{t+i}\right)}{Var\left((E_t-E_{t-h}) y_t^{(n)}\right)},
\]
so that instead of one-period innovations, the variances are for
innovations over $h$ periods.

Our earlier theoretical model can provide closed form
analytical expressions for these variance ratios. For one-period
and $h$-period innovations, respectively, these expressions are
\begin{eqnarray*}
  VR_1^{(n)} &=& \frac{\sigma_\xi^2 + a_c(n) \sigma_u^2}{\sigma_\xi^2
                 + a_c(n) \sigma_u^2 + \sigma_\eta^2 + a_g(n)
                 \sigma_v^2 + \left(\frac{B_n^x}{n}\right)^2
                 \sigma_w^2}, \\
  VR_h^{(n)} &=& \frac{h\sigma_\xi^2 + a_c(n)b_c(h) \sigma_u^2}{h\sigma_\xi^2 + a_c(n) b_c(h) \sigma_u^2 + h \sigma_\eta^2 + a_g(n) b_g(h) \sigma_v^2 + \left(\frac{B_n^x}{n}\right)^2 b_x(h) \sigma_w^2},\\
             && a_i(n) = \left(\frac{1-\phi_i^n}{n(1-\phi_i)}\right)^2, \quad b_i(h)
                = \frac{1-\phi_i^{2h}}{1-\phi_i^2}, \quad i = c, g, x.
\end{eqnarray*}
These expressions will help elucidate the factors determining the variance ratios.

An important result of Duffee's analysis is that even for long-term
bonds, $VR_1^{(n)}$ appears to be surprisingly small. This can be understood
through the lens of our model by noting that
\[
\underset{n \rightarrow \infty}{\lim} VR_1^{(n)} =
\frac{\sigma_\xi^2}{\sigma_\xi^2 + \sigma_\eta^2 + \left(
    \frac{\lambda_{\pi^\ast x} + \lambda_{r^\ast
        x}}{1-\phi_x}\right)^2 \sigma_w^2 }.
\]
This ratio will be small if shocks to the equilibrium real rate ($\eta_t$) and to
the risk-premium factor ($w_t$) make more important contributions to yield innovations than shocks
to the inflation trend ($\xi_t$). One plausible interpretation of Duffee's
finding is that at a quarterly frequency the trend in inflation
moves much less than the term premium component of long-term interest
rates. Such movements in the term premium, which is a catch-all
component for price movements not attributable to
changes in real-rate and inflation expectations, could be due to a
variety of factors including changes in risk-sentiment and ``animal spirits.'' This interpretation is
consistent with additional evidence in Duffee's paper on the role of
the term premium, and with a large body of evidence on excess
volatility of interest rates, going back to
\cite{shiller-79}.

Another way to try to understand the role of inflation expectations
for bond yields is to consider longer horizons instead of one-period
innovations. This appears promising because
\[
\underset{h \rightarrow \infty}{\lim} VR_h^{(n)} =
\frac{\sigma_\xi^2}{\sigma_\xi^2 + \sigma_\eta^2},
\]
so asymptotically, this inflation variance ratio is only affected by changes
in the trend components. Changes in term premia become irrelevant at
very low frequencies if, as in our model, the risk premium factor $x_t$
is stationary. Of course, variance ratios for large $h$
do have the drawback that as $h$ increases, so does the overlap of
the observations; therefore, we quickly loose degrees of
freedom and precision in our estimates. However, the profile of variance
ratios across horizons should give us additional insights about interest
rate dynamics, even if the maximum horizon is limited in practice by
data availability.

Estimation of the variance ratios requires modeling expectations of inflation
and interest rates. Like Duffee, we also consider a simple combination
of survey-based inflation expectations as represented in $\pi^\ast_t$ and
martingale interest rate forecasts, which allows us to calculate variance
ratios based on observed changes in the data. For example, we can calculate
a simplified $h$-period variance ratio as
\[
\widetilde{VR}_h^{(n)} = \frac{Var\left(\Delta_h \pi^\ast_t\right)}{Var\left( \Delta_h
  y_t^{(n)}\right)}, \qquad \Delta_h z_t = z_t - z_{t-h}.
\]
For any given $n$ and $h$, $\widetilde{VR}_h^{(n)}$ differs from
$VR_h^{(n)}$ because the variances in the simplified ratio include movements
that were anticipated at $t-h$. However, in many cases, these differences
are likely to be small. For example, as the maturity of the bond increases,
the 1-period simplified variance ratio approximates Duffee's ratio:
\[
\underset{n \rightarrow \infty}{\lim}\widetilde{VR}_1^{(n)} =
\frac{\sigma_\xi^2}{\sigma_\xi^2+\sigma_\eta^2 + \left(
    \frac{\lambda_{\pi^\ast x} + \lambda_{r^\ast x}}{1-\phi_x}
  \right)^2 \frac{2}{1+\phi_x} \sigma_w^2} \approx \underset{n
  \rightarrow \infty}{\lim}VR_1^{(n)},
\]
where the accuracy of the approximation depends on how close
$2/(1+\phi_x)$ is to one, i.e., on how persistent the risk-premium
factor $x_t$ is. The lower the persistence of $x_t$, the more $\phi_x$
is below one, which pushes $\widetilde{VR}_1^{(n)}$ somewhat smaller than
$VR_1^{(n)}$. In addition, as the time span of the changes increases,
the two versions of the inflation variance ratio also approach
each other in the limit:
\[
\underset{h \rightarrow \infty}{\lim} \widetilde{VR}_h^{(n)} =
\frac{\sigma_\xi^2}{\sigma_\xi^2 + \sigma_\eta^2} = \underset{h
  \rightarrow \infty}{\lim} VR_h^{(n)},
\]
Thus, for low-frequency movements, the two inflation variance ratios
are asymptotically identical.

Figure \ref{fig:vr} shows simplified variance ratios for the
five-year and ten-year yield, as well as for the 5-to-10-year forward
rate. The simplified inflation variance ratios based on changes convey
information about the relative importance of fluctuations in long-run
inflation expectations. Similarly, we also calculate the variance
ratio for fluctuations in the real-rate trend by simply using changes in the observed
$r^\ast_t$. In addition, we also calculate the contribution of
overall trend component $i^\ast_t = \pi^\ast_t + r^\ast_t$.
We calculate variance ratios for changes in $\pi^\ast_t$,
$r^\ast_t$ and $i^\ast_t$ for changes from one quarter to $h=40$
quarters.

For the inflation trend, we find that one-quarter variance ratios are
around 0.1. This result is consistent with Duffee's
findings and indicates that changes in the inflation trend play a small role for variation in
yields at the quarterly frequency. When we consider changes at lower frequencies, however, we find that
movements in the inflation trend play a substantial role for changes
in interest rates. The point estimates of the $\pi^\ast_t$-variance
ratio quickly increase with the horizon, and for $h=40$ reach a
magnitude of around 0.3.

The variance ratio for changes in the real-rate trend, i.e.,
$Var \Delta r^\ast_t/Var\Delta_h y_t$, is much lower than the
one for the inflation trend, remaining below 0.1 even at the longest
horizon. This is unsurprising in light of Figure \ref{fig:data1},
which shows that over the full sample the movements in $r^\ast_t$ were
substantially less pronounced than movements in long-term interest
rates and the inflation trend.\footnote{This finding may partly reflect
our use of an average of different estimates for $r^\ast_t$---some of
the individual estimates exhibit distinctly more volatility.} Of
course, this perspective of unconditional
variances should not be taken to conclude that changes in the
equilibrium real rate are unimportant for interest rate dynamics,
given the ample evidence in Sections
\ref{sec:cointegration}--\ref{sec:returns} of the importance of
$r^\ast_t$ for modeling and forecasting interest
rates. Furthermore, since our evidence suggests that
$r^\ast_t$ has become a relatively more important driver of changes in
long-term interest rates over recent decades, we venture the guess
that conditional variance ratios would show a switch from $\pi^\ast_t$
to $r^\ast_t$ as the dominant driver of low-frequency
changes.\footnote{Due to the paucity of data, conditional
  variance ratios would need to be obtained using a model with
  stochastic volatility, in order to impose structure on variances across frequencies and
  increase the efficiency of the estimates (at the cost of possible
  misspecification).}

We now focus on the variance ratios
$Var \Delta i^\ast_t/Var \Delta y_t$ to assess the overall
importance of the trend components in interest rates. Confidence
intervals are obtained using the asymptotic distribution of the sample
variances and the delta method. To account for persistence in
conditional variances, Newey-West estimates of long-run variances are
used.\footnote{We use 12 quarterly lags for all long-run variance
  estimates as indicated by the automatic
  lag selection procedure of Newey and West.} These
confidence intervals may understate the true sampling
variability due to the small number of nonoverlapping observations,
which decreases the reliability of the asymptotic approximations.
With this caveat in mind, Figure \ref{fig:vr} shows that while the sampling
uncertainty around the variance ratios for changes in $i^\ast_t$ is
substantial we can be reasonably confident that these
variance ratios increase from below 0.15 to a range of around 0.25 to
0.4, depending on the maturity of the interest rate. The highest
levels are reached for the 5-to-10-year forward rate---the
confidence interval at $h=40$ extends from about 0.3 to 0.4---which is
consistent with the notion that distant forward rates are more
strongly affected by the trend components.

Our model, like any model with a trend component for interest
rates, implies that the variance ratios for $i^\ast_t$ approach one
for sufficiently large $h$, but our estimates top out around
0.4. One possible explanation is
that we are simply not capturing the trend component with sufficient
accuracy. The true trend components might well be more (or
less) variable than the proxies we have available. However, we have provided
ample evidence that our trend proxies are closely linked to the
low-frequency movements in interest rates. A more plausible
explanation might be that the largest values of $h$ that we consider
are simply not large enough, which is a problem that we cannot solve without more data. At
the horizons we do provide estimates for, the estimates are increasing
substantially with $h$, but even at $h=40$ the cyclical/transitory
components of interest rates appear to still play a substantial
role. This could be due either to the cyclical components in inflation
and real rates, or, more likely, to the fact that the risk-premium
factor itself is sufficiently persistent/trending that it drives
interest rate variation at such low frequencies.

To shed additional light on the respective roles of trends and cycles
we report in Table \ref{tab:vr} the variances of changes in interest
rates, in the trend component $i^\ast_t$, and in the cycle components
$y_t - i^\ast_t$. The variance of yield changes can be decomposed as follows:
\[
Var(\Delta_h y_t) = Var(\Delta_h i^\ast_t) + Var(\Delta_h y_t -
\Delta_h i^\ast_t) + 2 Cov(\Delta_h i^\ast_t, \Delta_h y_t -
\Delta_h i^\ast_t).
\]
Table \ref{tab:vr} reports all three components. In the data, the contribution of the covariance is small
at short horizons, but substantial at long horizons. The two last
columns of Table \ref{tab:vr} report, first, the same variance ratio
shown in Figure \ref{fig:vr}, and second, a ratio that also includes
the covariance contribution in the numerator. This second ratio rises
to over 0.7 with horizon, which in turn implies that the cycle
component by itself explains only less than 30\% of the variance of
interest rate changes at low frequencies. These estimates raise some
additional questions, such as how to reconcile the strongly positive
covariance with our model, which assumes that shocks to trend and
cycle are uncorrelated.\footnote{Measurement error would have to be of
  a very specific form to explain this finding by itself, because classical measurement
  error in our estimate of $i^\ast_t$ would lead to a downward bias
  in the sample covariance.} But what seems clear from these results
is that while changes in the trend components are unimportant for
interest rate at high
frequencies (such as one-quarter changes), they play a crucially important role for
driving low-frequency movements in interest rates.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we have provided new evidence that interest rates are
closely related to the trend in inflation and the equilibrium real
rate of interest. Our empirical approach employed existing
estimates of these stochastic trends to investigate
this relationship from a variety of perspectives. We showed
that accounting for these trend components can help understand, model, and forecast long-term interest rates
and bond returns. Our results confirm the predictions of no-arbitrage
theory for the links between macroeconomic trends and the yield curve,
and they demonstrate that these links are quantitatively important.

Our findings open up several avenues for future research. Most
importantly, they demonstrate the advantages of yield curve models
that allow for slow-moving changes in the long-run mean of
inflation and the real rate. This applies to both reduced-form
no-arbitrage models as well as to more structural, equilibrium models
of the yield curve. The purpose of specifying and estimating such
models is typically to understand bond risk premia/term premia and
risk compensation, and constructing the necessary long-run expectations without
accounting for shifts in stochastic trends is likely to give
misleading results for risk premia.

An additional dimension to consider are the changes over time in the
relative importance of the macroeconomic trends in accounting for
long-run interest rates. For example,
it is well known in empirical macroeconomics \citep[e.g.,][]{stock-watson-ucsv} that the
trend component of inflation was much more variable in the 70s and 80s
than in more recent decades. This raises the question how our (mostly
unconditional) results are affected by taking a conditional
perspective. Furthermore, this suggests that incorporating not only
macroeconomic trends but also stochastic volatility in these trend
components will be crucially important for term
structure models.
