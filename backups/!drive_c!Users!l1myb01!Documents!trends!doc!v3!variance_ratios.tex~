As a final avenue of empirical examination, we compare the variance of
changes in the trend components of
inflation and real rates to the variance of interest rate changes
at different frequencies. \cite{duffee-inflation-risk} proposes using the ratio of the
variance of inflation news to the variance of innovations in nominal
interest rates as a useful metric to assess the importance of inflation
in the determination of interest rates. He documents that for
one-quarter innovations, this ratio is small for U.S.~Treasury yields.
We generalize his measure to
consider variance ratios for longer $h$-period innovations, which allows us
to compare the size of unexpected changes, over, say, a span of five years, in
inflation and in nominal bond yields.
For one-quarter changes, we replicate the small inflation variance ratio
reported by Duffee. But in line with our theoretical predictions, the
inflation variance ratio increases substantially with the horizon. We also
generalize Duffee's measure to incorporate fluctuations in $r^\ast_t$ and
$i^\ast_t$. Although confidence
intervals are unavoidably wide, our estimates suggest that during the postwar
U.S.~sample, a large share of the interest rate variability faced by investors over longer
holding periods was due to changes in the macroeconomic trend components of nominal
yields.

 Section \ref{sec:horizons} provides new variance
ratios for assessing the importance of the inflation and real-rate
trends for interest rate changes at different frequencies.
