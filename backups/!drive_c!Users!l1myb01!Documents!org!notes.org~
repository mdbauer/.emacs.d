* Notes on conversations
** chat with Lewis Alexander (Nomura) [2013-12-16 Mon]
background:
- current situation
  - economist in the financial research section at FRBSF
  - 3.5 years of service
  - research focused on understanding macro-finance linkages
    - modeling the term structure of interest rates - economics, statistics
    - effects of macroeconomic and policy news on interest rates
    - how do LSAPs affect long-term rates and term premia
    - conduct policy and understand interest rates at the zero lower bound
  - three publications, four revise-and-resubmit at good and very good journals
  - both single-authored and co-authored, in particular working closely with Glenn Rudebusch
- very satisfied with
  - the position I am in right now
  - the trajectory at FRBSF
  - my split research/policy, which is about 80/20 right now
  - colleagues and co-authors
- there has always been the appeal of a private-sector alternative for me
  - be productive in a different way -- efficient, fast, client-oriented, performance-driven
  - be a market participant -- instead of being at the Fed and wondering what market participants think/do
- timing
  - don't feel the urge to leave the Fed at this point in my career
  - also, Fed at critical juncture, and I want to be part of it
  - see myself seriously considering private sector in 5-10 years
- at this point, trying to understand my outside options
  - what types of jobs could I jump into right now
  - what possibilities might be there *down the road*
  - what are my trade-offs

- is he filling out the Dealer survey every six weeks?

- why are forward rates substantially lower than survey-based short-rate expectations

interview:
- runs U.S. economics for Nomura
  - in U.S. about 2000 people - classic broker-dealer
  - core business: FI and equity trading, focus on FI -- securitized products, credit, FX
  - Japanese-based investment bank
  - small team, service external clients and internal clients
  - lost senior member, now they're 4 people
  - person that left: high-frequency forecasting job -- economic releases, commentary
  - he would like to change the way things are done
  - he split in that function and distributed it
  - new person: responsible for part of the economy -- consumption or housing
  - and: doing modeling -- connection between macro outlook and interest rates
  - what they've done: mid-size macro model -- do stochastic simulation -- distribution of short rates in the future
  - think about yield curve in that context
  - FAIR model -- classic Keynesian model, no forward-looking expectations, but long-rates are determined by forward looking expectations of short rates
  - but he's looking to do modeling in a slightly different way: New Keynesian (DSGE?) model
  - and: link this more closely to term structure issues
    - risk premium across the yield curve, determinants of risk
  - he's not a time series macro guy but a lot of stuff they do is related to that
  - sell-side economics role
    - they spend a lot of their time talking to people that are not economists
    - communication side of the job very important
- clients:
  - they are really smart: dumb people don't survive on the Street
  - incredibly motivated: if you have something new then they want to try it
  - they speak a different language, and they have ADD
  - they are oberwhelmed by information, firehose -- they have to be very efficient, they don't have time to listen for 20 minutes
  - you have to communicate in a different way
  - *if you deeply understand something, you can usually explain it well*
- me -- explaining all of the above
- outside options
  - have to think about long-term goals
  - if I wanted to preserve the option of academic appointment then Street job would make that harder
  - it is true now, that if you want to preserve the option of senior policy roles, there is a stigma associated with coming to Wall Street
    - that might not last forever, might not be rational, but it's true today
  - Fed is a little sleepy, private sector seems like something I should consider seriously
    - he likes the steady stream of questions coming at him
    - there are always new questions
    - there is not always enough time to pursue interesting questions
    - it's not ``gee it's too quiet'' but really the opposite
    - people understand that you don't have enough time
    - people expect a quick answer, and a best guess, they know it's not thorough analysis
    - they know it's not your last answer, it's your first answer
  - is it fun for me to be in a room with motivated people that are not economists -- yes!
- intellectual characteristics by successful traders
  - you have to come to a view, can't be paralyzed by uncertainties
  - be good at thinking about a problem and coming to a solution
  - but: what happens after that? conclusions get challenged. constantly reassess their logic.
  - they need to know when to change your mind -- gotta be able to realize you are wrong
  - incentive structure for academic economists is very different -- he finds the Street more appealing for this reason
  - the constant challenge imposes discipline on the process
- person with my background -- what can I do in this world?
  - how technical and quant do I want to be?
  - his background: international economics, modeler, emerging markets, not a lot of data, big conceptual issues (hyperinflation, fiscal sustainability)
  - working on the U.S.: lots of data, level of sophistication has gone up, audience become more technical, interest/tolerance for sophisticated analysis
  - this makes the environment more interesting for me, for the more technical-minded people
  - there's some people that make a living not by being right but by being interesting and by stimulating thinking
  - on the other hand, there are people who are more quantitative, tied to the data, tied to the model, being more concrete
  - distributions/uncertainty: quantitative view can make a difference
  - and there is a different, pure-finance space, asset pricing problems
  - that's not what he is doing: macroeconomist

**** his research
- moderne Investitionstheorie
  - stochastische Fixkosten
  - SS Entscheidungsregeln
    - zuerst von Dotsey-King-Wolman (1999, QJE) fuer Price-Setting
    - von Julia Thomas (2002, JPE) auf Investitionen uebertragen
    - Thomas hat die gesamte moderne Investitionstheorie begruendet
  - fuehrt zu Lumpy Investment
  - wichtig um Mikrodaten zu matchen
- Investment in New Keynesian models
  - oftmals Kapital constant -- no investment
  - haeufig convex adjustment costs
    - sehr smoothes Investitionsverhalten
    - steht im Widerspruch zu Mikrodaten
  - Woodford's Kapitel zu Kapital/Investment in NK model ist falsch,
    wie von Lutz Weinke in seiner Dissertation dokumentiert
- Puzzle dass Todd Sweeny und Weinke in 2013 JME paper dokumentieren
  - add lumpy investment (moderne Investitionstheorie) in standard New
    Keynesian Modell
  - Ergebnis: gute Eigenschaften von NK Modell gehen verloren
    - viel zu hohe Reaktion von realen Variablen zu monetaeren Schocks
    - alle Investieren auf einmal, und dann nicht mehr
    - keine Persistence
  - Reaktionen von Monetarists (Gali/Woodford): Investitionstheorie
    ist schlecht
  - Reaktionen von Investitions-Leuten: sticky prices? diese Forschung
    konzentriert sich auf RBC Modelle

*** Philipp Koenig
**** Wirtschaftsforschungsinstitute
http://www.leibniz-gemeinschaft.de/start/
Wirtschaftsforschungsinstitute die zur Leibniz Gemeinschaft gehoeren:
*die wichtigstern Institute in Deutschland*
- DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung (DIW)
- Institut für Weltwirtschaft an der Universität Kiel (IfW)
- ifo Institut Leibniz-Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung an der
  Universität München e. V. (ifo)
- Leibniz-Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH)
- Rheinisch-Westfälisches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung (RWI), Essen
- Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung (WZB)
- Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW), Mannheim
**** Target
- in den USE ist der ISA ein rein buchhalterischer Vorgang, hat keine
  oekonomische Bedeuting
- Sinn/Wollmershaeuser haben zurueckgerudert
  - letzter Vorschlag war noch das Absichern der Target Salden mit Staatswerten
  - das haette im Effekt eine Beschraenkung der Kapitalfluesse
    bedeutet
- Target Salden haben Risiko -- Austritt aus dem Euro
  - dieses kann man vermeiden indem man die Assets der Nationalen
    Zentralbanken (die die Sicherheiten der Bankkredite beinhalten) an
    die EZB uebertraegt
    - das ist politisch nicht machbar
  - daher gibt es praktisch keine Moeglichkeit dieses Risiko zu
    vermeiden
**** Regulation: Liquidity requirements
- LCR Liquidity Coverage Ratio
  - weighted average of assets (high weight=high liquidity) must
    excess short-term (<30 days) liabilities
  - this ignores that banks can easily trade in their less liquid
    assets at the ECB to obtain liquidity
  - this hurts banks because they now have to hold additional
    liquidity for every bank loan that is financed with deposits
- Net Stable Funding Ratio
  - "proportion of long-term assets which are funded by long-term,
    stable funding"

*** Joerg Rocholl
- ich soll mich jederzeit wieder melden wenn ich in Berlin bin

*** Raffaella Giacomini
- see notes about her paper
chat with her:
- she is over yield curve research since it seems like you step on too
  many people's feet and it's hard to publish in good journal
- unspanned/hidden factors: if you tilt forecasts to match survey
  forecasts, it turns out that you create a hidden factor
- about trend inflation:
  - Müller and Watson (2008, 2013) have work on uncertainty in
    estimation of long-run mean
    - crucially requires stationarity

  - im wissenschaftlichen Beirat von https://www.weltsparen.de/
- wird zwei Papers an AEA/AFA in San Francisco vorstellen
*** Helmut Luetkepohl
zu unserem Paper: see pred.org

zu Bayesian Methods:
- very common because it's easy to do, easily defensible (do what
  others do)
- often done because we can impose parsimony on a model
  - but of course it's still problematic to have high-dimensional model!
- big problem: can't impose uninformative prior on structural
  parameters of SVARs
  - (largely) uninformative priors on reduced-form parameters can
    imply informative priors on structural parameters!
- if the likelihood has multiple maxima and is badly behaved, then
  Bayesian inference will be problematic as well
- generally, it's often hard to see what exactly is going on, so
  people feel like they are probably safe

*** Lars Winkelmann
zu unserem Paper:
- why not specify VAR/ARDL model and test for Granger causality?

zu BEI rates and anchoring:
- Strohsal and Winkelmann (2015) Assessing the anchoring of inflation
  expectations
- news regressions -- changes of BEI on macro surprises -- imply that
  BEI rates are random walks!
  - even if beta is insignificant
  - this isn't plausible
- can remedy this using mean-reverting model, in particular ESTAR
  works well for them
- here anchoring although beta \neq 0 !
- gamma measures degree of anchoring
  - if gamma=0 then BEI rates are random walk both locally and globally
  - if gamma \neq 0 then BEI rates are random walk locally but
    mean-reverting globally

- 1970s
  - Bretton Woods
    - Amerikaner haben sich geweigert abzuwerten
    - haben dementsprechend den Vietnam-Krieg auf dem finanziellen
      Ruecken der anderen Staaten ausgetragen die immer mehr Dollar
      kaufen mussten
    - viele haben dann in London Dollar gekauft was der City geholfen
      hat zu wachsen
    - Bretton Woods in effect ended in 1971 - end of convertibility of
      dollar into gold
  - in the middle of this, oil shock because OPEC countries wanted to
    hurt U.S.
  - inflation quickly rose from 3-4 to 7-8 percent
  - Burns and the Fed looked completely stupid
  - labor unions were very strong back then, so they were able to push
    through substantial wage increases -- wage/price spiral
  - Jimmy Carter's policies didn't work --
    http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Jimmy_Carter_Budget_&_Economy.htm
    -- which helped Reagan win the presidency
- Wenn ich Interesse an einer Karriere in Deutschland habe oder an
  einem Sabbatical, soll ich mich bei ihm melden.
- Labor Macro:
  - why is wage so stable if real variables are so volatile?
  - you need a very high wage elasticity of labor
  - but this doesn't match with micro evidence
  - matching models can fix this
  - Shimer-Puzzle: V/U is more volatile in the data than in the models

*** Lukas Menkhoff
- S-Professur -- DIW bezahlt Gehalt an das Land, welches das Gehalt an
  den Professor bezahlt -- Prof. ist eigentlich an der Uni aber muss
  kaum unterrichten und ist in Wirklichkeit am Institut
- BERA (auch von vielen anderen erwaehnt)
  - Berlin Economics Research Associate (BERA) Program to promote
    post-doctoral research
  - im Prinzip eine Brand um Postdoc Stellen besser zu vermarkten
  - https://econjobmarket.org/postings.php?posid=3521
- Fricke und Menkhoff - Financial Conditions, Macroeconomic Factors
  and Disaggregated Bond Excess Returns
  - nicht so wirklich sein Kernthema, Fricke war sein Student
  - Fricke bei Bundesbank in Financial Stability, wuerde sich freuen
    mich einmal kennenzulernen falls ich in Frankfurt bin

- Predict currency excess returns
  - it's common practice to try to find undervalued currencies by
    making predictions of excess returns
  - people have found that it works to use the 5-year change in the
    real rate
  - this is all about "value" strategies for exchange rates
  - alternative strategies are "carry" (this is what Lustig-Verdelhan
    is all about) and "momentum" -- *they have a paper on each, former
    in JF, latter in JFE!*
  - in their paper "Currency Value" they relate differences in
    predictability to structural factors
  - they still need a good economic story
  - unrelated but noted in this paper: "Kozicki and Tinsley (2005)
    find that long-run weighted averages for U.S. inflation match
    survey inflation expectations for the U.S. quite well." Kozicki,
    S., and P. Tinsley (2005): “Permanent and Transitory Policy Shocks
    in an Empirical Macro Model with Asymmetric Information,” Journal
    of Economic Dynamics and Control, 29, 1985–2015.

- Lustig and Verdelhan (AER) was a major landmark, they set a new
  standard in this literature

- term structures and FX rates
  - Huichou Huang hat ein Papier wo er nicht nur Zinsen sondern
    Zinsstrukturen miteinbezieht
  - Lukas ist nicht klar ob das Papier Sinn macht oder ob nur viele
    Regressoren in einen Topf geschmissen werden ohne Theorie
  - Ich koenne wahrscheinlich besser beuurteilen wie man das richtig
    aufschreiben sollte

take-aways:
1. Naechstes mal frueher melden so dass er was organisieren kann
2. Wenn Huichou Huang zum DIW kommt dann meldet sich Lukas


*** Marcel Fratzscher
- Leibniz Gesellschaft:
  - eine von vier Gesellschaften - Max-Planck, Franhofer, Helmholtz
  - http://www.research-in-germany.org/en/research-landscape/research-organisations/
  - fokussiert auf Sozialwissenschaften
  - finanziert 50% Staat, 50% Land in dem das Institut sitzt
  - alle 7 Jahre gibt es einen Review durch Wissenschaftler
  - dann kann es sein dass man zugemacht/abgewickelt wird!
    - Beispiel: Hamburg HWWA, ifo in den 90ern (dann vom Land komplett
      uebernommen und von Sinn aufgepeppelt), Halle war knapp
- Makro-Vorhersage
  - jedes von 6 Instituten macht eine Vorhersage
  - alle 3 Jahre gibt es eine Ausschreibung fuer die Vorhersage der
    Bundesregierung -- 4 Konsortien erhalten den Zuschlag
  - diese pruegeln sich dann um die genau Vorhersage und die
    wirtschaftspolitischen Empfehlungen
- DIW
  - steht traditionell eher mehr links
    - andere sind richtig hardcore neoklassisch: kein Mindestlohn,
      keine antizyklische Fiskalpolitik, keine Schulden
  - im internationalen Vergleich ist DIW eher in der Mitte
- EZB Politik
  - kaufen jeden Monat 60 Millarden Euro
  - haben jetzt im Dezember noch mal einen Zahn zugelegt:
    1. Einlagezins von -0.2 auf -0.3
    2. Basis ausgeweitet -- auch regionale Bonds und Agencies
    3. Reinvestment
    4. Verlaengerung des QE Programms um 6 Monate bis Fruehling 2017
    5. [TBC]
  - Deutsche Wissenschaftler sind extrem kritisch
    - Key Argumente: Anreize fuer Peripherie, Finanzstabilitaet
    - z.B. Otmar Issing und Juergen Stark sind sehr laut
    - aber die EZB hat ein festes Mandat zur Preisstabilitaet, und
      sowohl headline als core sind weit unter 2%!

** Hamburg Visit - July 2016
*** Lena Draeger [2016-07-01 Fri]
- Michigan survey about inflation
  - they answer by giving that inflation rate which is relevant
    for them [so maybe that is the one that matters for wage demands]
- disagreement about inflation and unemployment
  - disagreement about interest rates is explained mostly by
    disagreement about inflation (from her "disagreement according to
    Taylor" paper)
  - disagreement about inflation is counter-cyclical, whereas
    disagreement about unemployment is pro-cyclical
- my question: does disagreement about interest rates decrease in
  tightening cycles? what are the cyclical properties of disagreement?
  - easy question to answer from SPF/Michigan
  - there likely is existing work on this
- her question: is interest-rate smoothing stronger in tightening
  cycles? it seems like it from a casual inspection of the time series
  of policy rates
  - would be easy to test using U.S. data

* Big picture notes
- find my exact focus area and keep working exactly there
  - no-arbitrage term structure models with macroeconomic variables
  - both reduced form and structural models!
=> *Estimation of asset pricing models*

- I should be the expert on European monetary policy at the SF Fed

* Feedback on soft skills and communication
Glenn: In seminars, be careful not to be *dismissive* of comments and
questions. Listen and try to understand and acknowledge what people
have to say.

Mark: Tone matters.

Mary: Sit back and listen first, instead of jumping in. Argument may
get lost in the heat of the debate. Instead *take notes* and prepare
the points I want to make.

* Research ideas
** How do macro variables and the yield curve interact?
  - spanning vs. cointegration?!?!
** *time-varying predictive power of term spread for excess returns*
** what linear combination of yields is most strongly correlated with future returns?

*** Pegoraro 2014 Intl gov yield curve factors
The yield curve literature has focused not only on the specification and estimation of models
explaining the term structure of interest rates in a single economy but, more recently, has been
extended to the relevant problem of specifying and estimating the joint dynamics of international
yield curves. In the single-country case, the estimation and implementation of dynamic yield
curve models has found that three (the level, slope and curvature factors to five latent factors
are required to match the dynamics and the shapes of the term structure. In the multi-country
setting, in contrast, we observe substantial lack of agreement, not only about the number of latent
factors that are required to explain the joint dynamics of two or more countries¡¯ yield curves, but
also about the common/local nature of the factors where each common factor affects yields in all
countries while each local factor affects yields in only one country.

** work with Y-14 data
- securities in bank portfolios:
http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2015/02/available-for-sale-understanding-bank-securities-portfolios.html#.VxqTp9UrJaQ
"recent research (Hanson and Stein, 2015) argues that banks respond to expansionary monetary
policy by lengthening the maturity of their securities portfolios, in
an effort to boost yields."
" In contrast, U.S. Treasuries make up only a relatively small part of
AFS and HTM portfolios. One line of academic research (Hansen et al, 2014) argues that
banks, because of their access to stable deposit funding, are
“patient” investors that have a comparative advantage in holding
assets that are higher-yielding but relatively less liquid or that
have greater short-run price risk. "


*** Hanson and Stein (2015)
We go on to provide some evidence that is consistent
with our hypothesis about the role of yield-oriented
investors. We do so by looking at the maturity of securities
held by commercial banks. Banks fit with our conception
of yield-oriented investors to the extent that they care
about their reported earnings, which, given bank account-
ing rules, are based on current income from securities
holdings and not mark-to-market changes in value. We
find that when the yield curve steepens, banks increase
the maturity of their securities holdings. Moreover, the
magnitudes of these portfolio shifts are large in the
aggregate, so that if they had to be absorbed by other, less
yield-oriented investors (e.g., broker-dealers or hedge
funds) they could plausibly drive changes in market-
wide term premia. We also find that primary dealers in
the Treasury market—who, unlike banks, must mark their
securities holdings to market—take the other side of the
trade, reducing the maturity of their Treasury holdings
when the yield curve steepens.

We use quarterly Call Report data on the duration of
commercial bank security portfolios to test the hypothesis
that banks act like the yield-oriented investors in our
model.

** macro data releases
Glenn: this is related to our view that not all macroeconomic data releases are the same:
*** Fed (Board of Governors): Is the Intrinsic Value of Macroeconomic News Announcements Related to their Asset Price Impact?
http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2015/files/2015046pap.pdf
**** Abstract
The literature documents a heterogeneous asset price response to macroeconomic news
announcements: Some announcements have a strong impact on asset prices and others
do not. In order to explain these differences, we estimate a novel measure of the intrinsic
value of a macroeconomic announcement, which we define as the announcement’s
ability to nowcast GDP growth, inflation, and the Federal Funds Target Rate. Using
the same nowcasting framework, we then decompose this intrinsic value into the announcement’s
characteristics: its relation to fundamentals, timing, and revision noise.
We find that in the 1998–2013 period, a significant fraction of the variation in the
announcements’ price impact on the Treasury bond futures market can be explained
by differences in intrinsic value. Furthermore, our novel measure of timing explains
significantly more of this variation than the announcements’ relation to fundamentals,
reporting lag (which previous studies have used as a measure of timing), or revision
noise.
**** my summary
try to explain why some data series have more impact on interest rates
intuition: they have more information content
formalize: they help nowcast the economy
- different factors: fundamentals, timing, revisions

** DTSMs: new way to incorporate survey data to get better P and Q measure
** estimate macro effects of LSAPs
*** JW's comments
what are the effects of long-rate changes vs. short-rate changes on spending?
- the effects on the macro economy are baked into the cake in most models
  (Vasco's model; FRB/US)
- Woodford paper
http://conference.nber.org/confer/2013/FCMPf13/woodford_conference_submit.pdf

  - preferred habitat is not enough
  - you get financial market effects of LSAPs but not macro effects
  - it's still only the short-rate that matters for spending
*** monetary transmission
- SVAR approach - typically: short rate, macro vars in SVAR
- there are surely papers that have done this with short and long rates and assess relative impact
- take a detailed term structure perspective: affect of yields at *all maturities*
*** Kevin - transmisison channel
1. run cross-correlations of yield changes with spending growth
2. condition on observables
 - this is simply 'local projections'
Q: what does the term structure of macro covariances look like
- (cov/corr, R^2, zero vs shape restrictions; CIs for these estimates)
Q: how does conditioning change this term structure?
- condition on past macro data (Taylor rule?) (shocks vs. systematic?)
- presumably no need to condition on past yields?
DTSM - next step: what does the model-implied covariance of a macro-finance DTSM look like?
- spanned vs. unspanned macro-finance model -- what does it imply
- how do different models look, relative to the data?

** Forward guidance and Taylor rule
- the idea for outcome-based forward guidanec was to show the market
  that the reaction function has changed
- Matt Raskin's paper looks for evidence on this using the response of
  quantiles of interest rate distr.
- one might be able to tease this out using a shadow rate model
- would need a daily model

Glenn: I think with a macro-finance model, we can distinguish the
Odyssean and Delphic elements of forward guidance events.  (see ECB
note)
- estimate daily macro-finance ZLB model
- Taylor rule
  - have the parameters changed?
  - sub-sample analysis?
  - residuals for of a rule that is unchanged?

** new model for term premium
- term premium that is more smooth and less volatile
- maybe have a separate residual, not only TP serving as residual
  - similar to some Fair-Value models which people are using
*** build DTSM inspired by Wall Street fair value models
see MarketSource note "Dealer Fair Value Models for the 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yields"
https://marketsource.ny.frb.org/publish/view/primerep081612.pdf
many risk factors! need tight parameter restrictions!
*** relationship between implied vol and term premium
- often reported that correlation is high
  - particularly over recent period
  - see for example DB - The Fed and Bond Risk ("other projects" folder)
- but there is an important level effect
  - higher rates mean higher implied vol
- the causality therefore goes in both directions
  - and: higher policy expectations also mean higher implied vol
  - so higher IVs not necessarily a sign that term premium increased
- how can we tease out the information in implied volatilities?
** QE and interest rates
What is the ``present value effect'' of taking Treasuries out of the market?
Goal: estimate effects of QE for QE2/QE3 where announcement effects were small.
- empirical question: what is the range of estimates for the effect on the 10y yield of a change in the present value of LSAPs
- crucial: depends on measure of present value
- PV estimated based on expectations of future LSAPs
- policy announcements change PV discretely
- in addition, PV evolves continuously over time
  -> jump-diffusion? / small shocks-big shocks?
- PV is affected by
  - pace of purchase
  - timing of tapering and ending purchases
  - exit strategy expectations (selling/holding until maturity)
- data sources:
  - expectations from primary dealer survey -- 20 obs. 2011-2013
  - policy announcements provide timing of jumps
  - sometimes policy announcements include amounts
- estimate effects of changes in PV on interest rates
  - identify causal effect!
    -> control for response of PV and interest rates to macro data
- relative to these estimates, how much can we explain fundamentally
  using duration removal/fair value models/signaling effects

** new paper "restrictions/forecasting in DTSMs"
- different types of restrictions:
(a) rank
(b) zero restrictions
(c) linear combinations
- maybe: relation of reduced form restrictions to structural restrictions

** Structural models and the SDF
become more familiar with consumption-based asset pricing models
- survey Campbell (2003), Handbook of the economics of finance
- what restrictions on SDF do structural models imply.
  -> review of various models and see how they restrict pricing kernel
  -> testable using affine DTSM?
** regression-based tests of the EH
does the bias really go in the direction that if we correct for it,
we reject EH even more consistently?
1. get a detailed understanding of Bekaert-Hodrick-Marshall, replicate
2. replicate Cochrane-Piazzesi results
3. bias-correct various test regressions, including CP05


** Effects of monetary policy on risk premia
Analyze how Fed policy actions have affected uncertainty and risk premia
 in financial markets, both historically and in recent instances of policy actions
during and after the financial crisis. Existing literature has focused on
the effects of policy actions on prices/returns, while the effects on second
moments and risk premia have received relatively little attention.

** determinants of the long term nominal yield
- observation: graph of 10y u.s. yield, secular rise, then secular decline
*** inflation expectations
- moving inflation target of the Fed is arbitrary, not identified, can explain away anything
*** real rate
- let's take as given some inflation expectations. what drives the real rate?
*** growth rate
- issue of treasury bonds inelastic or driven by economic growth/business cycle?
supply vs. issue?
- firms consider cost of capital in comparison to project returns.
both long term productivity trends as business cycle affect these returns.
  -> supply of corporate bonds/demand for credit should covary with project returns
- is demand for bonds determined by growth considerations?
- this question is really: what is the real rate ?
  what are demand and supply curves? what moves demand and supply?
*** relation between long yield and savings rate
observation: secular decline in the savings rate
- which way does causation go when considering yields/real rate and savings?
- demand shift/shock or just a walk down the demand curve?
- other secular shifts in demand factors for bonds? foreign sovereigns?
- to answer this question, you need to decompose the long yield !
- decrease in real rate? if yes this could have been a factor to lower personal savings
- what theoretically would be the effect of inflation expectations on saving?
observation: sharp increase in the savings rate (not caused by yields !!?)
- wealth shock has exogenously increased the savings rate. use exog. financial variable
  as instrument to identify demand shifts
- how does the shock that increased u.s. domestic demand for bonds/stocks
  (2008-2009 increase in savings rate) show up in bond markets ?

** equity premium
estimate risk premium in equities together with risk premium in bonds
*** related paper
Maximum likelihood estimation of the equity premium by Efstathios Avdis, Jessica A. Wachter  -  #19684 (AP EFG TWP)
The equity premium is usually estimated by taking the sample average of returns.  We propose an alternative estimator, based on maximum likelihood, that takes into account additional information contained in dividends and prices.  Applying our method to the postwar sample leads to an economically significant reduction from the sample average of 6.4% to a maximum likelihood estimate of 5.1%.  Using simulations, we show that our method is robust to mis-specification and is substantially less noisy than the sample average.

- but could come in situation where it pays more in interest than it
  takes in
* Topics/Glossary
** Pecuniary externailty (11/18/2013)
- an externality that is due to changes in prices, not through technology/real resources
- with complete markets, price effects offset each other, and eqbm is still efficient
- Farhi-Werning (2013) A Theory of Macroprudential Policies in the Presence of Nominal Rigidities
  - they provide a different justification for macroprud. policies than a large literature which
    starts from incomplete markets and a pecuniary externality
  - they explain intuition about incomplete markets/pecuniary externality in Arrow-Debreu economy
** Negative convexity
- MBS have negative convexity
  - as interest rates rise, duration increases, because prepayment speed is lowered
  - price decreases accelerate with higher rates
  - price function concave
- in contrast, Treasuries have positive convexity
  - with higher rates, duration decreases
  - price decresaes are smaller for higher rates
  - price function

** Floor vs corridor system
*** floor system
- large volume of central bank liabilities (reserves + RRP)
- control of short-term rates through rates paid by central bank on its liabilities
- more lending to the central bank
*** Corridor system
- rates on central bank substantially below market rates
- maintain only a small amount of excess reserves in the system
- more short-term lending between financial institutions
*** references
- see Gagnon and Sack (2013), Goodfriend (2002), Kahn (2010), Keister (2012)
** Hansen-Jagannathan bound
  standard deviation of a stochastic discount factor to its mean exceeds the Sharpe Ratio attained by any portfolio
** Size-adjusted power
- Usually power comparison are carried out adjusting for the size (size-adjusted power), when there are significant
size-distortions.
- Using the empirical size, rather than the nominal
level, in power caluclations will lower the power of oversized tests
and increase that of undersized ones, making different tests directly
comparable.
- However, as stressed by Horowitz and Savin (2000), who go
as far as describing size-adjusted power as ¡±irrelevant for empirical
research¡±, this advantage comes at the expense of the relevance of the
Monte Carlo simulations for actual empirical work.
*** Horowitz and Savin
- usually null hypotheses are not simple -- they don't completely specify the DGP
- the size is the supremum of the test's rejection probability over
  all DGPs contained in H0
1. the "size-corrected critical value" is the c.v. that makes the size
  equal to alpha
  - rarely done because typically very difficult to do
2. the Type I critical calue is what we would get if the true DGP was known
  - depends on unknown parameters
  - can be approximated by using asumptotic distribution of test statistic
  - most test statistics are *asymptotically pivotal* -- don't depend
    on unknown population parameters when H0 is true
  - short-coming: first-order approximation can be very inaccurate in
    small samples
- "size-corrected critical values" usually obtained in Monte Carlo
  studies of power are both misnamed and irrelevant to empirical
  research.
- they really use critical values for essentially arbitrary simple
  null hypotheses
- what is really computed is the exact Type I critical value at a
  specific and essentially arbitrary parameter in H0
- the critical value has no empirical analog and cannot be implemented
  in an application
point of this paper: the bootstrap can often be used to obtain a good estimator of the true Type
I critical value
*** my intuition
power: how often do I reject a false null
in Monte Carlo simulation:
- simulate data under true null
  - calulate size of the test
  - obtain critical value for which the empirical size is equal to nominal size
- simulate data under alternative
  - reject only if test exceeds this "size-adjusted critical value"
** Super consistent estimator
a consistent estimator that converges at a rate faster than rate sqrt(n)
- with a deterministic ternd, OLS is super consistent and asymptotically normal
- if there is a cointegrating relationship between two I(1) variables, then the OLS estimator of the cointegration equation is super-consistent
  - Stock (1987) “Asymptotic properties of least squares estimators of
    cointegrating vectors”, Econometrica 55, 277-302, shows that OLS
    estimator converges at rate T instead of sqrt(T)
in other words:
- if I regress two trending variables on each other, I generally have a spurious regression
- if there is an equilibrium relationship -- residual is I(0) -- then I recover this using OLS
NOTE: the way to test this is to do an ADF test for the residuals
=> in either case, the t-statistics are not interpretable
=> the only important question is whether the residuals are stationary or not

** Learning / non-rational expectations
*** George Evans explains it like this:
- Constant Gains Learning is really CG Discounted Rescursive Least
  Squares - you discount past observations
- Recursive Least Squares is really decreasing gains learning - you
  don't discount past observations - equally weighted
he has a paper "Can perpetual learning explain the forward-premium
puzzle?" that shows learning can explain the forward premium puzzle

*** Coibion and Gorodnichenko (AER, 2015)
- sticky info: Mankiw-Reis, Reis (2009)
- noisy information / rational inattention
- evidence for information rigidities

** Forward premium puzzle
*** Fama (1984)
documents that most of the variation in forward rates is
variation in premiums, and the premium and expectations components of
forward rates are negatively correlated
*** Backus, Foresi, Telmer (2001)
state the Fama condtions as follows:
1. negative covariance between expected depreciation rate q_t and
   expected excess return/forward risk premium p_t
2. greater variance of p_t than q_t

find that affine term structure models can't explain forward premium
puzzle
- requires a lor of variation in conditional variances, and negative
  correlation between differences in conditional means and conditional
  variances of the two pricing kernels
- "anomaly hinges on some sort of asymmetry between the distribution
  of the two kernels"
- two solutions
  - allow negative interest rates in a model with a common factor
  - or have a certain asymmetry that they consider implausible
    - estimates imply price of risk "far in excess of that which
      generates realistic risk premiums on other fixed-income payoffs"
 -> "estimates indicate that each of these alternatives has serious shortcomings"

all their models have constant prices of risk! open question: does relaxation of this constraint
-- by using more modern affine models -- resolve the difficulty?
*** Chakraborty and Evans (2008, JME)
- simple model with constant gains learning can account for forward
  premium anomaly
two approaches to explain FPA:
- the common approach is to try to explain the anomaly with a
  time-varying risk premium, but they claim there is "geneeral
  skepticism of the risk-premium explanation"
- instead they pursue an approach of nonrational expectations, like a
  few other papers as well
** Quantile regression
sources:
- short introduction in Cameron-Trivedi textbook Microeconometrics, chapter 4.6
- Koenker and Hallock (2001, JEP) survey article
- original paper: Koenker and Bassett (1978)

quantiles:
- optimal predictor in case of specific piece-wise linear loss
  function (different slopes q and 1-q for positive/negative values of
  the residual)

idea of quantile regression:
- focusing only on conditional mean function - linear regression -
  gives an incomplete summary of the joint distribution of dependent
  and explanatory variables
- linear regression assumes that the slope is the same no matter where
  we are in the distribution of x
- quantile regression estimates a different slope for each quantile
  - one estimates the "conditional quantile functions"
- note: it's the different quantiles of the *dependent variable*
  - so the usual quantile-slope plots show the different slope
    coefficients at different points in the distribution of the
    dependent variable
  - that's why it makes perfect sense to have such a plot for a
    regressor that is binary

relation to heteroskedasticity:
- with linear multiplicative heteroskedasticity, the conditional
  quantiles are linear
- fanning out of regression lines (in univariate plot/scatter plot) is
  interpreted as evidence of heteroskedasticity

applications:
- various application in microeconomics cited in Koenker-Hallock
- used in empirical finance to estimate Value-at-Risk

open questions:
- how can it be used in time series data, with serial dependence?
- what is quantile-quantile regression?
** Discount window
- collateralized borrowing
- primary credit, secondary credit, and seasonal credit
  - primary credit is of higher quality, lower haircuts, less
    oversight; 50 bps above fed funds rate
- loan data is published with two years lag
- markets can often figure out who borrowed
- change in 2003
  - prior to 2003, DR below fed funds rate -- bank could only borrow
    if it had exhausted other sources
  - new regime with classifications, higher DR

** Forward/backward regressions
Bandi and Perron (2008) [key reference] use them to uncover
risk-return tradeoff
- regress h-period forward return on h-period backward variance
- huge overlapping-return problems, but they argue that the result is
  robust to this, using Valkanov t/sqrt(T) statistic
-> you still have the same econometric problems

unemployment rate is close to the NAIRU—then in fact one is better off
using a univariate forecast than introducing additional estimation error
by making a multivariate forecast. But if the unemployment rate is far
from the NAIRU, then knowledge of that large unemployment gap is
useful for inflation forecasting."

*** How is targeted maximum likelihood related to all of this?

Athey and Imbens (2015) "Machine Learning Methods for Estimating
Heterogeneous Causal Effects"
"Another line of work that is similar in motivation to ours is the work on Targeted Maximum
Likelihood (van der Laan and Rose, 2011). This approach is also motivated by the idea that es-
timation approaches should be tailored towards the parameters of interest, so that bias/variance
tradeoffs are optimized for the most important parameters. Targeted maximum likelihood ap-
proaches modify the loss function to increase the weight on the parts of the likelihood that
concern the parameters of interest. The methods are semi-parametric, and importantly they
rely on a parametric model for the parameters of interest. Our approach is focused on nonpara-
metric estimates of τ(x) in an environment where there may be a large number of covariates x;
thus, a parametric model is likely to be restrictive and it may not be possible to incorporate all
covariates in “big data” settings where the covariate space is large
relative to the sample size."

*** what R packages are available?
** Forecast evaluation
Harvey, Leybourne, Newbold (1997) proposed finite-sample correction to
Diebold-Mariano test that can improve size and has become widely
popular

Diebold (2015) Comparing Predictive Accuracy, Twenty Years Later= A
Personal Perspective on the Use and Abuse of Diebold-Mariano Tests
- retrospective on DM test
- Wright's comment gives great intuition
- Wright concludes to just use DM with (a) rectangular window (instead
  of Newey-West) and (b) Harvey et al finite-sample adjustment
- this is also what he does in Faust-Wright (2012), where they also
  have a nice explanation
=> use DM test, compare to N(0,1), to test the null of *equal
finite-sample forecast accuracy*

Clark and McCracken (2013) Advances in Forecast Evaluation
- detailed treatment
- from Faust-Wright: "Clark and McCracken find that comparing the
  Diebold and Mariano (1995) test statistic to standard normal
  critical values gives a test of the null hypothesis of equal
  finite-sample forecast accuracy (in both the nested and non-nested
  cases) that has size fairly close to the nominal level, provided
  that the standard errors use the rectangular window with lag
  truncation parameter equal to the forecast horizon, and the
  small-sample adjustment of Harvey, Leybourne, and Newbold (1997) is
  employed."

short-run restrictions - originated with Sims (1980):
- based on idea that there's a natural timing in the effects of economic shocks
- for example, MP cannot react to price level at time t because of info lag

[[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~lkilian/elgarpublication.pdf][Kilian (2013) Handbook of Research Methods and Applications in Empirical Macro]]
SVARs have four main empirical applications:
1. impulse responses
2. forecast error variance decomposition
3. historical decompositions
4. forecast scenarios conditional on hypothetical sequences of shocks

- King and Rebelo (1993) Low frequency filtering and real business
  cycles
- Hodrick and Prescott (1997) Postwar US business cycles: an empirical
  investigation
  - this is the published version of their seminal paper
*** Baxter and King (1999) Measuring Business Cycles: Approximate Band-Pass Filters for Economic Time Series
- consider linear, symmetric filters
- requirement: response at frequency zero is zero <=> weights sum to
  zero. This removes stochastic and linear trends from the original
  time series.
  - a filter whose weights sum to zero has a(L) = (1-L)b(L) so it
    removes a stochastic trend
  - for a stationary series, the Wold representation of its first
    difference is a(L)=(1-L)b(L) and a(1)=0; the long-run response of
    the level is zero
- optimal bandpass filter let's through only certain frequencies
- given desired frequency responses of low-pass filter, we can
  construct the weight (time domain representation of filter) using
  *inverse Fourier transform*
  - on the other hand, frequency response is just DFT of filter
    weights
- band-pass filter has weights that are differences of weights of two
  different low-pass filters
- approximate bandpass filter is optimal approximation: minimal
  squared deviation from freq. response of optimal filter, given that
  we only include K leads and lags
  - general result (on Fourier series approx) implies that we can
    simply drop lags beyond K

- nice explanation of frequency response, relation to spectrum, and
  how freq. response of filter simply multiplies frequency response of
  original series
  - Cramer representation -- see also Cochrane TS book page 97



- criticizes frequency domain method to band-pass filtering
  - this approach takes Fourier transform of the data and zeros out
    the frequencies outside the band of interest, then inverse Fourier
    transform to get filtered series
  - criticism: prior detrending necessary; depends on whole sample
- detailed discussion of HP filter (based on King-Rebelo (1980)
  - theoretical HP filter is low-pass filter with smooth frequency
    response profile (instead of step function)
  - can be derived from probability model where trend is I(2) and
    cycle is white noise
  - they recommend bandpass filter because it's easier to do at
    various data frequencies whereas HP lambda only clear for quarterly
  - however, they say that IF you do HP filter for annual data, use
    lambda = 10

      P-distributino of inflation. But an affine model without
      restrictions on risk pricing just uses the information in the

- how does this affect/determine bid-ask spreads?

- heterogeneity of investors with regard to
  (a) attitudes towards risk and
  (b) beliefs about adverse outcomes
- risk-averse investors lend
- if fraction of endowment held by risk-averse investors increase, the
  safe real interest rate falls
- if composition of investors shifts towards risk-averse/pessimistic
  investors then real interest rate falls
- China sheds risk by lending to U.S., which absorbs risk

Marty Eichenbaum's discussion of Hall's paper:
- Hall's hypothesis is that fall in real interest rate reflects
  optimal response to decline in global inequality
- he does not think that risk-sharing (level) plays a large role in
  the fall (change) of the safe real interest rate
- Hall identifies poor as more risk-averse (China, Russia)
  - domestic version doesn't work since inequality has been rising
  - but globally inequality has been falling so it could work
- Hall's evidence: foreigners hold more debt than equity, so they must
  be more risk-averse
  - Marty challenges the time series evidence
  - rise between 2003 and 2007 but no trend after 2007
  - see figure in Maggiori (2017, AER, forthcoming?)
    - that paper: changes in international risk-sharing are not because of risk
      aversion, but because of financial markets
  - China's share in U.S. debt has been going *down* since 2008

- consumption/wealth ratio has fallen substantially since the 1970s
- simple empirical approach using the world budget constraint
- understand decline in, and forecast future global real rates
- closely related to their other 2016 paper on safe asset providers
- upshot: it's not productivity or demographics, but deleveraging and
  other factors -- debt overhang, global financial cycle, safe asset shortage
- BUT: forecast power is strongest at *long horizons* which raises a
  host of econometric issues

Stock (1987) Asymptotic properties of least sqaures estimators of
cointegrating vectors
- shows that OLS is superconsistent

- [[../Papers/W/Watson%20(1994)%20Vector%20Autoregressions%20and%20Cointegration.pdf][Watson (1994)]] handbook chapter
  - inference about cointegration

Stock and Waton (1988) Testing for Common Trends
show how to express a nonstationary vector as sum of random walk
components and stationary components

another way to extract a common trend (and highly cited)
Cochrane,  J.H. (1994) “Permanent  and Transitory  Components  of GNP  and Stock Prices”, Quarterly
Journal of Economics, 109, 241-266.

- King, Plosser, Stock, Watson
- Gonzalo and Granger (1995) estimate the common trend from a VECM
  model, by assuming that it is a linear combination of the observable
  variables
- Chang, Miller, Park (2009) focus on Kalman-filter based estimates of
  permanent component, and compare them to ECM (Gonzalo-Granger) trend
  estimates
  - they use a iid stationary component but claim that the filtered
    trend would be identical even if this was serially correlated
- Chang, Jiang, Park (2013) extend to multivariate trend
- *Harvey (1989) chapter 8.5*
- Kasa (1992) Common stochastic trends in international stock
  markets
  - focuses on testing number of common trends a la Johansen (1990)
  - explains identification issues for decomposition
  - lays out three different ways to decompose series:
    - multivariate Beveridge-Nelson a la Stock and Watson, KPSW
    - state-space method - refers to Aoki (1987, 1988) but those
      papers are unimportant
    - his own method based on projection -- basically means taking weighted
      average of five markets as the common trend (this is not purely
      random walk but also contains cycles) -- so common trend is also
      a linear combination of observable variables, just like Gonzalo
      and Granger
- Baillie and Bollerslev (1989) Common Stochastic Trends in a System
  of Exchange Rates
  - test for number of common trends (find one) but don't estimate
    common trends model

Pagan (1996) "The econometrics of financial markets" mentions common trend models
- "Many studies have been performed on the number
and nature of common trends in various asset price series, e.g., Baillie and
Bollerslev (1989) for exchange rates and Kasa (1992) for stock prices."
- common-trends common-cycles models for the term structure -- see Pagan
pages 69, 74 -- basically this is what yield curve models are about

  Frameworks, Accountability
  - real bill doctrine made monetary policy pro-cyclical

the Great Moderation: An Alternative Interpretation
- for determinacy with positive trend inflation, need much stronger
  response to inflation
- responding to output growth helps restore determinacy for plausible
  inflation response
- monetary policy has changed but not due to higher inflation
  response: interest rates have become more persistent, and Fed's
  response to output gap has increased

** Machine learning
according to Jake there are three ways how to use ML for policy/inference
*** 1. Double ML

[[http://economics.ucla.edu/2017/03/01/inference-using-machine-learning/][nice summary of this research]]
*** 2. Heterogeneous ATE
(use tree to split the data)
- Athey and Imbens "Recursive Partitioning for Heterogeneous Causal
  Effects"
- Wager and Athey "Estimation and Inference of Heterogeneous Treatment
  Effects using Random Forests"
- Athey and Imbens - "The State of Applied Econometrics - Causality
  and Policy Evaluation"

** Recovery theorem
- Thomas: this is Steve Ross' way to explain it
  - you have a n states, nxn transition matrix, and n marginal utilities
  - you have nxn option prices (n strikes and n maturities)
  - since there are only nx(n-1) unique probabilities and in total n^2
    unknowns, you can solve for them
- Audrino et al (2015) An Empirical Analysis of the Ross Recovery
  Theorem
  - https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2433170
  - some positive results: better market timing based on recovered
    moments better than risk-neutral moments
- Bakshi, Chabi-Yo, Gao (2015) A Recovery That We Can Trust?
  - http://scholar.rhsmith.umd.edu/sites/default/files/gbakshi/files/ross_recovery_12-2015.pdf
  - key assumption of Ross Recovery is that the "pricing kernel
    satisfies the transition independence property"
  - "backbone of these restrictions is that the martingale component
    of the SDF is unity"
  - but they show that there is a martingale component that "exhibits
    substantial dispersion"
- Borovicka, Hansen, Scheinkman (2015) "Misspecified Recovery"
  - show that what is recovered by Ross is the transitory comonent of the SDF
  - for the recovery theorem to hold, the martingale component of the
    SDF must be equal to unity

* International finance
** Current Account
- is one of the two components of Balance of Payments, other is Capital Account
- has the following components
  - balance of trade
  - net factor income
  - net cash transfers
- SURPLUS -- increases country's net foreign assets
  - "surplus country" is one with trade surplus and current account surplus
- "current" because goods and services usually consumed in current period
- current account surplus typically due to trade surplus
** Capital Account
- surplus: money is flowing into the country to finance current account deficit
  - borrowing or sales of assets
** Balance of Payments
- record of all economic transactions between residents of a country and rest of the world
- BoP identity: current account + capital account (+ statistical discrepancy) = 0

  anomaly and the risk premium: A survey of recent evidence
- classic work: Backus, Foresi, Telmer (JF, 2001)
