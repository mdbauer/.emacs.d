  \frametitle{A DSGE model for the term structure of interest rates}
  \begin{wideitemize}
  \item Contribution to large and growing literature on structural
    macro-finance term structure models \\ {\scriptsize (most recent:
    Rudebusch-Swanson, 2012; van Binsbergen et al, 2012; Andreasen,
    2012; Andreasen et al, 2016; Swanson, 2016)}
  \item Defining features of the model
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Productivity (supply) and uncertainty (demand) shocks drive
      long-term yields
    \item Uncertainty regimes switch the bond risk premium (high/low)
    \item Solution with second-order perturbation results in
      regime-switching intercepts in state-space model
    \end{itemize}
  \item Main empirical results
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Uncertainty shocks are to some degree cyclical
    \item Provide possible explain of increase in slope and term
      premium during recessions
    \item Productivity and uncertainty shocks each explain about 50\%
      of the variance in long-term yields
    \end{itemize}
  \end{wideitemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Inflation target assumed constant
\item But time-varying $\pi^\ast_t$ evident in the data
\item Reconciles volatility of LT yields
  with moderately persistent macro shocks (G\"{u}rkaynak, Sack, Swanson, 2005)
\item Has become common modeling practice\\{\small (H\"{o}rdahl, Tristani, Vestin, 2006;
    Bekaert, Cho, Moreno, 2010; Rudebusch and Swanson, 2012)}
% \item But constant $\pi^\ast$ in van Binsbergen et al (2012), Swanson (2016)
\item Shock to $\pi^\ast_t$ is change in policy stance
\end{itemize}
\onslide<3>
\begin{itemize}
\item Technology shock lowers inflation expectations
\item Effects of shock need to be very persistent
\end{itemize}
\onslide<4>
\begin{itemize}
\item Equilibrium real rate $r_t^\ast := \underset{h \rightarrow
    \infty}{\lim} E_t r_{t+h}$
\begin{itemize}
  \item Other definition....
\end{itemize}
\item Generally constant in DSGE models (deterministic SS)
\item But structural changes affect $r^\ast_t$\\(e.g., trend growth, demographics, global
  saving glut)
\item Evidence is strong that $r^\ast_t$ has decreased since 1990s\\
  {\scriptsize (e.g., Laubach and Williams, 2016; Bauer and Rudebusch,
    2017)}
\end{itemize}
\onslide<5>
\begin{itemize}
\item Increase in uncertainty raises precautionary savings and lowers
  current and future real rates
\item Technology shock temporarily increases real rates
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Policy rule features interest rate smoothing
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\onslide<6>
\begin{itemize}
\item Magnitude of term premium switches between high and low positive
  values with variance-regimes (uncertainty shocks)
\item Appears restrictive but parsimony may have benefits
\item Model generates \emph{countercyclical} TP, consistent with large
  body of evidence\\
{\scriptsize (e.g., Cochrane and Piazzesi, 2005; Bauer, Rudebusch, Wu, 2014)}
\item Note: $YTP_t^{(n)}$ is average of expected future excess returns
\end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Technology shocks}
\small
      \begin{itemize}
      \item \alert{Level} factor: yields at all maturities fall, no effect on TP
      \item Small, transitory effect on slope
      \item Required do be extremely persistent to fit yields
      \item ``Contrary to typical results [it] generates
        extremely persistent responses of macro variables''
      \item Model gives up on macro to fit finance, like Swanson (2016)

  \begin{block}{Uncertainty shocks}
\small
    \begin{itemize}
    \item ``Uncertainty shocks are [adverse] aggregate demand
      shocks'' (Leduc and Liu, 2016)
    \item Depresses real rates and increases term premium
    \item Large and persistent increase in \alert{slope} of the yield curve
    \item Why are macro effects gone after 4 quarters but yield curve
      effects persistent and very large? Is this plausible?

  \frametitle{The effects of monetary policy on the yield curve}
  \begin{block}{What the paper finds}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Changes in risk premia not caused by MP ($\sim$ by assumption)
    \item Monetary policy reacts to fluctuations in risk premia;
      consistent with Taylor rule (= aggregate demand shocks)
    \item Explanation for conundrum period
    \item MP has not been able to anchor inflation expectations (?)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Open questions}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item What are the effects of MP shocks?\\{\scriptsize (on yields,
        slope, real rates, infl.~exp, TP)}
    \item Open issue: does looser MP increase (Crump et al, 2016) or
      decrease (e.g., Hanson and Stein, 2015) TP?
    \item What are the effects of uncertainty about MP?
    \item Effects of communication/forward guidance puzzle?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}
% MP effects only short-term yields, not LT yields
% very small real and nominal effects on the economy
% no impact on TP by assumption
% hard to understand effects of MP on the yield curve in a model like this

% not necessarily bad thing that slope drives risk premia. consistent
% with Fama-Bliss, Campbell-Shiller
% But important to be clear about it: technology and uncertainty
% shocks are fitting the level and slope of the yield curve
% -> LT yields driven exclusively by these two shocks
% Is that desirable?
% Swanson: only one shock that drives all asset prices and risk premia
% give up on macro to fit finance
% To me it seems we should have more shocks that matter for yields: definitely long-run risk,
% preference shocks, shocks to inflation target, shocks to level of
% term premium that is unrelated to expectations/inflation target

  \frametitle{Key questions about yield curve/TP in DSGE model}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item How to specify the stochastic discount factor?
  \item How to price bonds?
  \item How to solve the model?
\vspace{1pc}
  \item How to generate positive average nominal slope/TP?
  \item Does the time series of the estimated TP look plausible?
  \item Is the average real slope/TP positive or negative?
  \item What are the key sources of (real/nominal) (long-run) risk?
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% wasn't clear how bond pricing is done in this model
% - see Meyer-Gohde for two different approaches

% discuss long-term inflation expectations
% -> they look just like yields!

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Conclusion}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item Plausible and intuitive mechanism for countercyclical TP
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Recession $\rightarrow$ higher uncertainty $\rightarrow$
        higher TP
      \end{itemize}
    \item Consider addressing additional questions with this model:
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item Effects of monetary policy on the yield curve
      \item Determinants of real and nominal risks
      \end{enumerate}
    \item Additional shocks/flexibility would relieve tension between macro and
      finance
