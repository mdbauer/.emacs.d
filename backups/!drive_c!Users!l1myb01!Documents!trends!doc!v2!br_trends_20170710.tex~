\section{Introduction}

The level of the risk-free real rate of return that would prevail in
the absence of transitory disturbances has long been of interest to
researchers, policymakers, and financial investors.
However, recent structural changes in the global economy have brought
questions about the variation and influence of this equilibrium real rate
to the forefront \citep{clarida-new-neutral,yellen-pace}. Various
underlying fundamental economic forces,
such as lower productivity growth and an aging population, appear
to have slowly altered global saving and investment and, in turn,
pushed down the steady-state real interest rate. Accordingly, much
new research has examined potential changes in the level of the
equilibrium real short-term interest rate, which we denote
as $r^\ast_t$.\footnote{\label{fn:rstar} Discussions of the
  decline in $r^\ast$ include \cite{hhhw}, \cite{rachel-smith},
  \cite{laubach-williams}, \cite{johannsen-mertens}, \cite{kiley},
  \cite{lubik-mathes}, \cite{christensen-rudebusch-rstar}, and \cite{holston-laubach-williams} among
  many others. In the macroeconomics literature, $r^\ast_t$ is often
  labeled the neutral or natural rate of interest.} Remarkably, thus far, there has been very little work
addressing the effects of changes in $r^\ast_t$ on the dynamics of the
term structure of interest rates. We fill this gap and analyze how changes in the equilibrium real
rate will alter yield curves and bond risk pricing.

A useful illustration of the potential importance of accounting for
the equilibrium real rate is provided in Figure \ref{fig:data1}. The
secular decline in the 10-year Treasury yield since the early 1980s
reflects a gradual downtrend in the general level of U.S. interest
rates. Early on, a key driver of this decline was the reduction in the
long-run expected level of inflation, which is often referred to as
trend inflation and denoted as $\pi^\ast_t$. Figure \ref{fig:data1}
displays a measure of U.S. trend inflation based largely on long-horizon
inflation projections from a survey of professional forecasters
(details of this measure are described in the data section
below). While the link between trend inflation and interest rates has
been highlighted by some, e.g., \cite{cieslak-povala}, this macroeconomic trend clearly cannot
account for all of the decline in yields on its own. For the past two decades,
$\pi^\ast_t$ has stabilized close to 2 percent while longer-term
interest rates have continued to drift lower. Instead, much of the
recent downtrend in yields seems to reflect a lower equilibrium real
short-term interest rate, as is evident in the simple composite
measure of $r^\ast_t$ shown in Figure \ref{fig:data1} (details of this
measure are also described below). According to this measure, the
equilibrium real short rate remained little changed in a range between
2 and 3 percent from 1970 to around 2000 when it started to gradually
fall to below 1 percent currently. We argue that accounting for this
recent downtrend in $r^\ast_t$ as well as the earlier decline
in $\pi^\ast_t$---that is, an environment of falling stars---is critical for
understanding the dynamics of interest rates and for assessing bond
risk and expected returns.

Long-term nominal interest rates reflect expectations of future
inflation and real short rates---including their trend
components---subject to a risk adjustment. We first demonstrate the
theoretical significance of such longer-run components in an affine
no-arbitrage term structure model that allows for stochastic trends in
inflation and the real short rate---$\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$. The
model shows that $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$ act as level factors for
the nominal yield curve, as suggested by Figure \ref{fig:data1}. In
addition, the model describes how the cyclical components of inflation
and the real rate disproportionately influence the shorter end of the
yield curve and how a risk-premium factor affects long rates more than
short rates. Our model leads to testable implications about the
importance of both $r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$ for interest rates,
which we take to the data. Our empirical examination considers five
tests of whether the trends in inflation and the real rate are
quantitatively important for the determination of interest rates,
using common empirical proxies of these macroeconomic
trends.

As a first test, we document that time variation in both $\pi^\ast_t$
and $r^\ast_t$ is responsible for most of the persistence in
yields. While interest rates themselves are extremely persistent, the
difference between long-term interest rates and the equilibrium
nominal short rate, which is denoted
$i^\ast_t = \pi^\ast_t + r^\ast_t$, exhibits quick mean
reversion. Furthermore, regressions of long-term yields on the
macroeconomic trends recover the unit coefficients predicted by our
theoretical model. Our findings generalize the results of
\cite{cieslak-povala}, henceforth CP, who regress nominal yields on a
proxy for trend inflation. While we confirm their finding that
$\pi^\ast_t$ is an important persistent component of interest rates,
we show that it is also crucial to include $r^\ast_t$ in order to
fully capture the trend component. Furthermore, after accounting for shifts in
$r_t^\ast$, we uncover strong evidence for a long-run Fisher effect,
which has found at best lukewarm support in previous studies that have
focused only on a bivariate relationship between yields and
inflation.\footnote{\label{fn:fisher}Prominent examples include
  \cite{mishkin92}, \cite{wallace-warner}, and \cite{evans-lewis}.}
Instead, from our broader perspective that allows for fluctuations in
the equilibrium real rate, we find that the trend components of
inflation and the real rate are related to interest rates exactly as
standard finance theory predicts.

Second, we show that accounting for both macroeconomic trends leads to substantial
improvements in interest rate forecast accuracy at medium and long forecast horizons
relative to the usual martingale forecasting benchmark. Our theoretical model
shows that such forecast improvements are a natural consequence
of the time series properties of inflation and the real short rate.
We document that, relative to the random walk alternative, the
improvements in forecast accuracy from including the trend
components are both economically and statistically significant.
In addition, as predicted by our model, to achieve these better forecasts,
it is crucial to incorporate $r^\ast_t$ in the shifting endpoint
of nominal interest rates---including only $\pi^\ast_t$ is insufficient.

Third, accounting for a time-varying $r^\ast_t$ is important
for understanding return predictability and estimating bond risk
premia. Recently, CP used the connection between trend inflation
and interest rates to decompose the nominal yield curve into risk
premiums and the expectations hypothesis (EH) component (i.e., a term
that equals the average short-term interest rate that investors expect
to prevail during the life of a bond). They present strong evidence
for the predictive power of the inflation trend for excess bond returns,
which suggests that incorporating the inflation trend is important to
understand the risk premium/EH decomposition. Since $r^\ast_t$ plays
the same role of a persistent level factor for nominal interest rates
as does $\pi^\ast_t$, our theoretical analysis then suggests that $r^\ast_t$,
like $\pi^\ast_t$, should have predictive power for bond returns. Hence, we
extend the results of CP by introducing shifts in the equilibrium
real interest rate into the prediction of risk premiums, and we find
substantial improvements from incorporating
$r^\ast_t$ in predicting excess bond returns.

Fourth, these bond return results suggest that measures of the bond
risk premium should account for movements in both $r^\ast_t$ and
$\pi^\ast_t$. Therefore, we provide an empirical decomposition of
long-term yields into expectations and term premium components that
takes into account the macroeconomic trends. We contrast our estimated
decomposition with a conventional one based on a stationary VAR of
yield-curve factors. The conventional decomposition implies an
implausibly stable expectations component and attributes most of the
secular decline in interest rates to the residual term premium, as
discussed in critiques by \cite{kim-orphanides} and \cite{brw2}.  Our
decomposition, which allows the mean of nominal yields to shift with
$i^\ast_t$, leads to a very different interpretation of the historical
evolution of long-term yields: the majority of their secular decline
is attributed to the decrease in $i^\ast_t$. Consequently, the term
premium, instead of exhibiting a dubious secular downtrend, behaves in
a predominantly cyclical fashion like other risk premia in asset
prices \citep{campbell-cochrane}.

As a final avenue of empirical examination, we compare the variance of
changes in the trend components of
inflation and real rates to the variance of interest rate changes
at different frequencies. \cite{duffee-inflation-risk} proposes using the ratio of the
variance of inflation news to the variance of innovations in nominal
interest rates as a useful metric to assess the importance of inflation
in the determination of interest rates. He documents that for
one-quarter innovations, this ratio is small for U.S.~Treasury yields.
We generalize his measure to
consider variance ratios for longer $h$-period innovations, which allows us
to compare the size of unexpected changes, over, say, a span of five years, in
inflation and in nominal bond yields.
For one-quarter changes, we replicate the small inflation variance ratio
reported by Duffee. But in line with our theoretical predictions, the
inflation variance ratio increases substantially with the horizon. We also
generalize Duffee's measure to incorporate fluctuations in $r^\ast_t$ and
$i^\ast_t$. Although confidence
intervals are unavoidably wide, our estimates suggest that during the postwar
U.S.~sample, a large share of the interest rate variability faced by investors over longer
holding periods was due to changes in the macroeconomic trend components of nominal
yields.

Taken altogether, these five complementary strands of evidence provide
the key contribution of our paper: strong empirical support for the
significance of macroeconomic trends in understanding the nominal
yield curve. Variations in both the inflation trend and the equilibrium real
interest rate are shown to be quantitatively important, and while the
former has been increasingly recognized in yield curve analysis, a
time-varying $r^\ast_t$ has been essentially ignored---a substantial
oversight in the literature. Our empirical evidence linking inflation
and real rate trends to the yield curve and risk pricing has
far-reaching implications for modeling of interest rates and bond risk
premia. In order to accurately capture interest rate dynamics, both
structural and reduced-form models of the yield curve should allow for
slow-moving trend components. The common approach of specifying a
stationary system for the term structure of interest rates with
constant means for the risk factors is problematic, because it
counterfactually rules out any structural, long-run changes of
economic variables and asset prices. Accounting for such long-run
changes, i.e., for shifting trends, is crucial for researchers and
practitioners assessing the term premium in long-term interest rates,
forecasting bond yields and returns, and understanding the drivers and
historical evolution of the term structure of interest rates.

Our paper relates to several strands of literature. A large literature
documents the importance of a trend component in the inflation rate,
notably \cite{kozicki-tinsley}, \cite{stock-watson-ucsv},
\cite{faust-wright}, and \cite{clark-doh}. The persistence in the real
interest rate is considered early on by \cite{rose} and was surveyed
by \cite{neely-rapach}. A related literature investigates
the long-run Fisher effect (see the references in footnote
\ref{fn:fisher}). Much recent literature uses macroeconomic models and data to
estimate the equilibrium real interest rate and to understand its
structural drivers (see the references in footnote
\ref{fn:rstar}). Our paper sheds a new light on these related strands
of literature by showing that the apparent trends in inflation and
real interest rates are not only consistent with the observed behavior
of the yield curve, but are in fact critially important to understanding
that behavior. Within the macro-finance literature on the term
structure of interest rates, some models have been proposed that allow
for changes in trend inflation; see \cite{htv}, \cite{rudebuschwu},
and \cite{bcm}. However these models, like essentially all equilibrium
models \citep[including][]{wachter,bansal-shaliastovich} and reduced-form
no-arbitrage models \citep[such as][]{chernov-mueller,jps} of the term
structure of interest rates, generally assume a constant equilibrium
real rate, in contrast to the findings of the literature cited
above.\footnote{The only exceptions we are aware of are \cite{abw},
  who allow regime switching in the mean of the real short rate, and
  the macro-finance models of Hans Dewachter and co-authors,
  including \cite{dewachter-lyrio} where $r^\ast_t$ is
  deterministically linked to $\pi^\ast_t$ and \cite{dewachter-iania}
  where $r^\ast_t$ is tied to trend output growth.}
Finally, we contribute to the literature on interest rate
forecasting. The work in this area most closely related to ours is
\cite{dijk-etal}, who documented improvements in forecast relative to a
random walk by including shifting endpoints that were linked to proxies for trend
inflation. We demonstrate that substantial further gains are possible
by forecasting that interest rates gradually revert to the endpoint
$i^\ast_t$ which includes the equilibrium real rate

The paper is structured as follows: Section \ref{sec:model} introduces
a simple no-arbitrage model of the yield curve that allows for trend
components in inflation and the real rates, and derives testable
implications. Section \ref{sec:data} describes our empirical proxies
for $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$. In Section \ref{sec:persistence}, we
investigate sources for the persistence of interest rates.
In Section \ref{sec:forecasting}, we show substantial improvements
in forecast accuracy are possible after accounting
for macroeconomic trends in interest rates. Section \ref{sec:returns}
documents the evidence for the incremental predictive power of
$\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$ for future excess bond returns. In Section
\ref{sec:tp}, we present a novel estimate of the term premium in
long-term interest rates that accounts for shifting endpoints. Section
\ref{sec:horizons} provides new variance ratios for assessing
the importance of the inflation and real-rate trends for interest rate
changes at different
frequencies. Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes.

\section{A no-arbitrage model with macro trends}
\label{sec:model}

Our theoretical framework is a stylized affine term structure model
for real and nominal yields that demonstrates how, under absence of
arbitrage, changes in $\pi_t^\ast$ and $r_t^\ast$---the inflation
trend and the equilibrium real short rate---affect interest
rates. Although our framework is quite parsimonious---with few risk
factors, no stochastic volatility, and strong risk pricing
restrictions---it is sufficient to provide some important testable
predictions about fundamental aspects of the relationship between the
trend in inflation, the equilibrium real rate, and the yield
curve.\footnote{This model generalizes the one in CP to
  allow for time variation in $r^\ast_t$ and flexible trend-cycle
  dynamic specifications.}

We model inflation, $\pi_t$, as the sum of trend, cycle, and noise
components:
\[ \pi_{t+1} = \pi^\ast_t + c_t + e_{t+1}, \quad \pi^\ast_t =
\pi^\ast_{t-1} + \xi_t, \quad c_t = \phi_c c_{t-1} + u_t, \]
where the innovations $\xi_t$ and $u_t$ and the noise component $e_t$
are mutually independent \emph{iid} normal random variables with
standard deviations $\sigma_\xi$, $\sigma_u$ and $\sigma_e$. Inflation
expectations at various horizons are given by $E_t \pi_{t+h+1} = \pi^\ast_t + \phi_c^h c_t$.
In the limit, expectations converge to the time-varying inflation endpoint,
$\underset{h \rightarrow \infty}{\lim} E_t \pi_{t+h}=\pi^\ast_t$,
which can be viewed as the perceived
inflation target of the central bank. This specification of
inflation dynamics is in line with the modern empirical
macro literature, which allows for a trend component in inflation
\citep[e.g.,][]{stock-watson-ucsv} and is similar to the one in
\cite{duffee-inflation-risk}. We assume that
the shocks $\xi_t$ and $u_t$ affect only expectations of future
inflation but not current inflation, which slightly simplifies the
bond pricing formulas but has no fundamental significance.

The one-period real rate, $r_t$, also has trend and stationary
components, respectively, the equilibrium real rate, $r_t^\ast$, and
the cyclical real-rate gap, $g_t$:
\[ r_t = r^\ast_t + g_t, \quad r^\ast_t = r^\ast_{t-1} + \eta_t, \quad
g_t = \phi_g g_{t-1} + v_t. \]
The shocks are again mutually uncorrelated and \emph{iid} normal, with
standard deviations $\sigma_\eta$ and $\sigma_v$. Since
$\underset{h \rightarrow \infty}{\lim} E_t r_{t+h} = r_t^\ast$, the
equilibrium real rate can be understood as the real rate that
prevails in the economy after all shocks have died out.

Formally, of course, this specification includes an exact unit root in
inflation and the real rate. We view this assumption merely as a convenient
way to model very persistent processes.  The use of unit roots
simplifies the exposition of our model and the arguments regarding
trend components, but it is not crucial.
Taken literally, a unit root specification is implausible because
the forecast error variances of inflation and real rates do not in fact increase
linearly with the forecast horizon as predicted by a unit root. Instead, both
variables have always remained within certain bounds.
However, in finite samples, a stationary process can always be approximated
arbitrarily well by a unit root process, and it is well-known that
doing so can often be beneficial for forecasting \citep[e.g.,][]{campbell-perron}.
Thus, $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$
can be viewed simply as highly persistent components of $\pi_t$ and
$r_t$ that capture expectations at the long horizons relevant for
investors, even if infinite-horizon expectations are constant. In practice,
these relevant time horizons are often in the 5- to 10-year range when cyclical shocks
have largely dissipated, as noted by \cite{laubach-williams} and \cite{summers-2015}.

The final state variable determining interest rates is a risk price
factor $x_t$, which follows an independent autoregressive process:\footnote{\cite{cp05}
provide evidence supporting a stationary single factor driving bond risk premiums. Also, see the discussion in CP.}
\[ x_t = \mu_x + \phi_x x_{t-1} + w_t, \]
where $w_t$ is \emph{iid} normal with standard deviation
$\sigma_w$. We collect the state variables as
$Z_t = (\pi^\ast_t, c_t, r^\ast_t, g_t, x_t)'$, so their dynamics can
be compactly written as a first-order vector autoregression, a VAR(1):
\begin{equation}
 Z_t = \mu + \phi Z_{t-1} + \Sigma \varepsilon_t, \label{eq:var}
\end{equation}
where $\mu = (0,0,0,0,\mu_x)'$, $\phi = diag(1,\phi_c,1,\phi_g, \phi_x)$,
$\Sigma = diag(\sigma_\xi, \sigma_u, \sigma_\eta, \sigma_v, \sigma_w)$,
and
$\varepsilon_t$ is a $(5 \times 1)$ \emph{iid} standard normal vector process.

The model is completed by a specification for the log real stochastic
discount factor (SDF), $m_{t+1}^r$, for which we choose the usual
essentially affine form of \cite{duffee02}:
\[ m_{t+1}^r = -r_t - \frac{1}{2} \lambda_t'\lambda_t -
\lambda_t'\varepsilon_{t+1}, \quad \lambda_t = \Sigma^{-1} (\lambda_0
+ \lambda_1 Z_t). \]
We only allow $x_t$ to affect the price of risk, so that the
first four columns of $\lambda_1$ are zero. Furthermore, shocks to
$x_t$ are not priced, so that the last element of $\lambda_0$ and the
last row of $\lambda_1$ are zero. The non-zero elements of $\lambda_0$
are denoted by $\lambda_{0\pi^\ast}, \lambda_{0c}, \lambda_{0 r^\ast},$ and
$\lambda_{0 g}$, and those of $\lambda_1$ by
$\lambda_{\pi^\ast x}, \lambda_{cx}, \lambda_{r^\ast x},$ and $\lambda_{g x}$.

The log nominal SDF is $m_{t+1}^n = m_{t+1}^r - \pi_{t+1}$, and the nominal
short-term interest rate is
\[ i_t = - E_t m_{t+1}^n - \frac{1}{2} Var_t (m_{t+1}^n) = r^\ast_t +
g_t + \pi^\ast_t +c_t - \frac{1}{2} \sigma_e^2. \]
Due to our timing assumption for the inflation process, and because
the noise shocks $e_t$ are not priced, there is no inflation risk
premium in the nominal short rate.\footnote{That is, $Cov_t(m_{t+1}^r,
  \pi_{t+1}) = 0$. CP make the same
  assumption, which is justified because estimates of this short-run inflation
  risk premium are typically very small. Note that the nominal
short rate equation can be related to the popular Taylor rule for monetary
policy in which $r^\ast_t + \pi^\ast_t$ represents the level of the policy-neutral
nominal short rate and $g_t + c_t$ captures the cyclical response of the
central bank.} Prices of
zero-coupon bonds with maturity $n$, denoted by $P_t^{(n)}$, are easily
verified to be exponentially affine, i.e., $\log(P_t^{(n)}) = A_n +
B_n'Z_t$, using the pricing equation $P_t^{(n+1)} =
E_t(\exp(m_{t+1}^n)P_{t+1}^{(n)})$. The
coefficients follow the usual recursions of affine term structure models \citep[e.g.,][]{angpiazzesi}:
\[ A_{n+1} = A_n + B_n' (\mu - \lambda_0) + C_n, \quad C_n :=
\frac{1}{2} (\sigma_e^2 + B_n' \Sigma \Sigma' B_n), \quad B_{n+1} =
-(1,1,1,1,0)' + (\phi - \lambda_1)'B_n, \] where $C_n$ captures the
convexity in bond prices. The initial conditions are
$A_0=0, B_0 = (0,0,0,0,0)'$. For the individual loadings of bond prices on the risk
factors we have
\[ B_{n+1}^{\pi^\ast} = B_{n}^{\pi^\ast} - 1, \quad B_{n+1}^c = \phi_c
B_n^c -1, \quad B_{n+1}^{r^\ast} =
B_n^{r^\ast} - 1, \quad B_{n+1}^g = \phi_g B_n^g - 1,\]
\[ B_{n+1}^x = -\lambda_{\pi^\ast x} B_n^{\pi^\ast} -\lambda_{cx}
B_n^c - \lambda_{r^\ast x} B_n^{r^\ast} - \lambda_{gx} B_n^g + \phi_x
B_n^x, \] and the explicit solutions are
\begin{gather*}
 B_n^{\pi^\ast} = -n, \quad B_n^c = \frac{\phi^n_c -
  1}{1-\phi_c},\quad B_n^{r^\ast} = -n, \quad B_n^g = \frac{\phi^n_g -
  1}{1-\phi_g},\\
B_n^x = \frac{\lambda_{\pi^\ast x} +
\lambda_{r^\ast x}}{1-\phi_x}\left(n - \frac{1-\phi_x^n}{1-\phi_x}\right)
+ \frac{\lambda_{cx}}{1-\phi_c}\left( \frac{1-\phi_x^n}{1-\phi_x} -
  \frac{\phi_x^n - \phi_c^n}{\phi_x - \phi_c} \right)
+ \frac{\lambda_{gx}}{1-\phi_g}\left( \frac{1-\phi_x^n}{1-\phi_x} -
  \frac{\phi_x^n - \phi_g^n}{\phi_x - \phi_g} \right).
\end{gather*}

For nominal bond yields, the model implies the following decomposition:
\begin{eqnarray}
y_t^{(n)} &=& -\log(P_t^{(n)})/n = -A_n/n - B_n'Z_t/n \nonumber \\
&=&  \underbrace{\pi_t^\ast + \frac{1-\phi_c^n}{n(1-\phi_c)}
    c_t}_{\sum_{i=1}^n E_t \pi_{t+i}/n} +
    \underbrace{r_t^\ast + \frac{1-\phi_g^n}{n(1-\phi_g)}
    g_t}_{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} E_t r_{t+i}/n} \quad \underbrace{ -A_n/n
    - B_n^x x_t/n.}_{\text{convexity and yield term premium}} \label{eq:yields}
\end{eqnarray}
This equation shows the effect of fluctuations in the trend and
cyclical components of inflation and real rates and the
risk-premium factor on interest rates of different maturities. The
trend components $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$ naturally act as level
factors by affecting yields of all maturities equally.\footnote{The
  constant loadings of yields on the trend variables shows that unit
  roots are also present under the risk-neutral measure.  Strictly
  speaking, this is inconsistent with absence of arbitrage---see
  \cite{dybvig-ingersoll-ross} and
  \citet[][p.~433]{campbell-lo-mackinlay}---because the convexity in
  $-A_n/n$ diverges to minus infinity. However, as in the case of the
  real-world measure, our predictions are unaffected if the largest
  roots under the risk-neutral measure are taken to be very close to
  but below one.} The cyclical components $c_t$ and $g_t$ are slope
factors as they affect short-term yields more strongly than long-term
yields, and their loadings approach zero for large $n$. The risk-premium
factor affects long-term yields more strongly than short-term yields:
The loadings of yields on $x_t$ start at zero and tend to
$\underset{n \rightarrow \infty}{\lim} -B_x^n/n = -(\lambda_{\pi^\ast
  x} + \lambda_{r^\ast x})/(1-\phi_x)$.  Thus, long-term yields
are mostly driven by the trend components $\pi^\ast_t$ and
$r^\ast_t$, as well as by the risk-premium factor
$x_t$. Appendix
\ref{app:dtsm} provides additional details and results for this affine
model, including expressions for forward rates.

The model has several predictions about the relationship between
interest rates and the two macroeconomic trends. A first
straightforward prediction is that for any yield maturity
$n$, the detrended yield $y_t^{(n)} - \pi^\ast_t - r^\ast_t$ will be
much less persistent than the yield itself. The difference in
persistence is particularly pronounced for long-term yields or forward
rates, which place a heavy weight on the trend components. Strictly
speaking, under the unit root specification, $y_t^{(n)}$ is I(1) while
$y_t^{(n)} - \pi^\ast_t - r^\ast_t$ is I(0). Furthermore, a regression
of $y_t^{(n)}$ on $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$ is a cointegrating
regression that should recover unit coefficients, since the
cointegrating vector of $(y_t^{(n)}, \pi^\ast_t, r^\ast_t)$ is
$(1, -1, -1)$.  The model also predicts that a partial detrending with
only the inflation trend will be much less successful. Namely,
$y_t^{(n)} - \pi^\ast_t$ will exhibit substantial
persistence. Similarly, a regression of $y_t^{(n)}$ on $\pi^\ast_t$ is
a spurious regression that will not recover a unit coefficient and
will produce residuals that remain highly persistent. We will
investigate these predictions empirically in Section
\ref{sec:persistence}.

The fact that interest rates do not have a constant mean but contain the
stochastic trend $i^\ast_t = \pi^\ast_t + r^\ast_t$ also has important
implications for yield forecasts. From \eqref{eq:var} and
\eqref{eq:yields} we have
\[ \underset{h
  \rightarrow \infty}{\lim} E_t y^{(n)}_{t+h} = k^{(n)} +
\pi^\ast_t + r^\ast_t,
\]
where the constant $k^{(n)}$ captures convexity and the unconditional
mean term premium. Hence, interest rates mean-revert to a ``shifting
endpoint'' \citep{kozicki-tinsley} that is driven by both
macroeconomic trends. For our empirical investigation we will ignore the
constant $k^{(n)}$, which is of second-order concern for our purposes here. The
model predicts that forecasts of long-horizon interest rates that
incorporate knowledge of $i^\ast_t$ are more accurate than forecasts
that ignore it. In particular, long-range forecasts that account for
$i^\ast_t$ should improve upon the common forecast benchmark of a
random walk. We will examine these potential forecast improvements empirically in
Section \ref{sec:forecasting}.

A third area in which macro trends may be empirically relevant is for the
prediction of excess bond returns. CP report substantial gains in such
prediction from including their measure of
trend inflation. In our model, as in CP's model, excess
bond returns, $rx_{t+1}^{(n)}$, are driven only by the risk premium factor $x_t$:
\[rx_{t+1}^{(n)} = p_{t+1}^{(n-1)} - p_t^{(n)} - y_t^{(1)}
= - \frac{1}{2} B_{n-1}' \Sigma \Sigma' B_{n-1} + B_{n-1}'(\lambda_0 +
\lambda_1 \iota_5)x_t + B_{n-1}'\Sigma \varepsilon_{t+1}, \]
where $p^{(n)}_t$ denotes the log-price of a zero-coupon bond with maturity
of $n$ quarters and $\iota_5$ is a $(5 \times 1)$-vector of ones. The better
performance found by CP in predicting excess bond returns with trend inflation
suggests that accounting for the trend component can uncover the
information about expected returns (i.e., about $x_t$)
that is contained in observed interest rates. In other words,
detrending interest rates with inflation helps estimate
bond risk premia. However, according to our model, the
equilibrium real rate can drive nominal yields in the same fashion as
the trend component of inflation. Therefore, our model's prediction is
that including not only $\pi^\ast_t$ but also
$r^\ast_t$ should improve the predictive power of excess return
regressions and the estimation of bond risk premia. We assess the roles of both trend
components for return predictability in Section
\ref{sec:returns}. Another measure of the bond risk premium is the
term premium in long-term yields, and in Section \ref{sec:tp}, we contrast term
premium estimates that account for shifts in $\pi^\ast_t$ and
$r^\ast_t$ with conventional estimates that do not.

Finally, the model predicts that macroeconomic trends should play a
particularly important role in accounting for interest rate changes
at low frequencies. The trend components are highly
persistent, so while their influence can be obscured by transitory
volatility at higher frequencies, they should
key drivers of interest rate changes over longer intervals (e.g., over
several years or more). This pattern implies that variance ratios of changes in the trend
components relative to changes in interest rates should exhibit a
pronounced tendency to rise with the span of the changes. In Section
\ref{sec:horizons}, we will use such variance
ratios to estimate the importance of the
trend components at different frequencies.

In sum, our stylized theoretical model provides clear predictions
about five aspects of the link between interest rates and
macroeconomic trends.  Of course, these predictions will be evident in
the data only to the extent that there is material variation in the
trend components. Furthermore, an empirical assessment requires
accurate estimates of $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$. Thus, our empirical
analysis should be viewed as tests of the joint hypothesis that (a)
the behavior of the trend components and their links to the yield
curve conform to our no-arbitrage model, (b) variation in the trend
components is quantitatively important, and (c) our empirical proxies
accurately capture the evolution of the trend components.

\section{Data and trend estimates}
\label{sec:data}

We now describe the data and the estimates of the macroeconomic trends
that we will use in testing the model's predictions.  Our data set is
quarterly and extends from 1971:Q4 to 2015:Q4. The interest rate data
are end-of-quarter zero-coupon Treasury yields from \cite{gsw} with
maturities from one to 15 years. We augment these data with three- and
six-month Treasury bill rates from the Federal Reserve's H.15 data. In
our empirical analysis, we mainly focus on long-term (five-year and ten-year)
yields as well as long-term (five-to-ten-year) forward rates to
exhibit the importance of $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$, and these are
the relevant horizons for our trend measures as well.

For measuring the macroeconomic trends, we simply take existing
estimates from the macroeconomics literature. Our goal is to assess whether
such off-the-shelf measures can provide evidence linking the
inflation and real rate trends to the yield curve and risk
pricing. An alternative strategy would be to estimate
time-varying $r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$ within a no-arbitrage term
structure model. Our approach, which conditions on existing
estimates, is more conservative, because our macro estimates of $r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$ have not been
fine-tuned to incorporate no-arbitrage restrictions or information in
long-term yields. We do not include trend estimates
that are based on information in the yield curve, such as estimates of
$\pi^\ast_t$ by \cite{clr} or estimates of $r^\ast_t$ by
\cite{johannsen-mertens}, \cite{christensen-rudebusch-rstar}, or
\cite{del-negro-rstar}. All our empirical trend proxies are based only on
information in macroeconomic variables, short-term interest rates and
surveys, in order to provide the cleanest evidence of the empirical links between
macro trends and the yield curve.

Several different empirical proxies for trend inflation, $\pi^\ast_t$,
are available including surveys, statistical
models, or a combination of the two---see, for example,
\cite{stock-watson-core} and the references therein. We
employ a well-known survey-based measure, namely, the Federal Reserve's
research series on the \underline{p}erceived inflation \underline{t}arget
\underline{r}ate, denoted PTR. It
measures long-run expectations of inflation in the price index of
personal consumption expenditure (PCE), and is often used in empirical
work---see, for example, \cite{clark-mccracken}. PTR is based
exclusively on survey expectations since 1979 (i.e., for most of
our sample).\footnote{Since 1979, PTR corresponds to long-run inflation
  expectations from the Survey of Professional Forecasters. Before 1979,
  PTR is based on estimates from the learning model for expected
  inflation of \cite{kozicki-tinsley}. For details on the construction of PTR, see
  \cite{brayton-tinsley}. PTR can be downloaded with the updates of
  the Federal Reserve's FRB/US large-scale macroeconomic model at
  \url{https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/frbus/us-models-package.htm}.}
Figure \ref{fig:data1} shows that from the beginning of our sample to
the late 1990s, this estimate mostly mirrored the increase and
decrease in the ten-year yield. Since then, however, it has been
essentially flat at two percent, which is the level of the longer-run
inflation goal of the Federal Reserve, which was first publicly
designated as such in 2012. Other survey
expectations of inflation over the longer run, such as the long-range
forecasts in the Blue Chip survey, exhibit a similar pattern. The inflation trend
that CP use is a simple weighted moving average of past core inflation, which,
as they note, co-moves closely with PTR.

The recent literature on macro-based estimation of the equilibrium
real interest rate has grown rapidly. These estimates almost invariably
rely on models with macroeconomic structural underpinnings and
macroeconomic data.\footnote{Alternative survey-based estimates of
  $r_t^\ast$ would require long-run expectations of both nominal
  interest rates and inflation. Unfortunately, the available time span
  for the former is quite limited (the earliest is a biannual Blue
  Chip Financial Forecasts series that starts in 1986) and they have
  also been found to be less accurate than forecasts of inflation
  \citep[see, for example,][]{dijk-etal}.}  A popular example is the
model of \cite{laubach-williams}, in which the unobserved natural rate
is inferred from macroeconomic data using a simple structural
specification and the Kalman filter. In Figure
\ref{fig:data2}, we plot the (filtered) Laubach-Williams estimate of
$r_t^\ast$. In addition, the figure also includes the estimates of
\cite{lubik-mathes}, who employ a time-varying parameter VAR model,
and \cite{kiley}, who augments the Laubach-Williams model with credit
spreads. Figure \ref{fig:data2} shows that since the early 1980s,
these three macro-based estimates have evolved in a broadly similar
fashion. A straightforward method to aggregate and smooth the
information from these three specific modeling strategies is to take their average.  In the
1970s, 80s, and 90s, this average fluctuated modestly between 2 and 3
percent, which is consistent with the common view of that era that
viewed the equilibrium real rate as effectively constant. However,
from 2000 to 2015, all of the measures fell, with an average decline
of 2.5 percentage points, consistent with the shifts in global saving
and investment that have been identified.\footnote{\cite{laubach-williams} and \cite{kiley}
  define $r^\ast_t$ as the neutral real rate at which
  monetary policy is neither expansionary nor contractionary. This
  differs from our definition (and that in \cite{lubik-mathes}) of
  $r^\ast_t$ as the trend (or long-run) component of the real
  rate. However, in the models of \cite{laubach-williams} and \cite{kiley},
  $r^\ast_t$ is assumed to follow a random walk, so the two
  definitions in fact coincide.}

Ideally, our trend estimates should reflect information that was
available contemporaneously to investors. Having a reasonable
alignment of $r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$ to the real-time evolution of
investors' information sets is particularly relevant for properly
assessing the value of macro trends in predicting future yields and
bond returns and determining the term premium in long-term yields (as
in Sections \ref{sec:forecasting}--\ref{sec:tp}). Since 1979, our
survey-based estimate of $\pi^\ast_t$ has been available to bond
investors at the end of each quarter, when our yields are
sampled. Real-time concerns have been more acute for estimates of
$r^\ast_t$ \citep{clark-kozicki}.  To construct $r^\ast_t$, we use
filtered (i.e, one-sided) estimates of the equilibrium real rate from the
three macroeconomic models cited above. That is, these estimates only use data
up to quarter $t$ to infer the unobserved value of $r^\ast_t$. While
the estimated model parameters are based on the full sample of final
revised data, \cite{laubach-williams-redux} show that truly real-time
estimation of their model delivers an estimated series of $r^\ast_t$
that is close to their final revised estimate over the period that
both are available. This suggests that an alternative real-time
estimation with real-time empirical trend proxies would be unlikely to
overturn our results.

Intuitively, our empirical measures of $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$ are
consistent with a compelling narrative about the evolution of
long-term nominal interest rates, as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:data1}. Starting with the Volcker disinflation of the 1980s,
interest rates and inflation trended down together. Around the turn of
the millennium, long-run inflation expectations stabilized near 2
percent. However, long-term interest rates continued to decline in
part because structural changes in the global economy started pushing
down the equilibrium real rate.  These structural changes likely
included slowdowns in trend growth in various countries, increases in
desired saving due to global demographic forces and strong
precautionary saving flows from emerging market economies, as well as
declines in desired investment spending partly reflecting a fall in
the relative price of capital goods \citep{rachel-smith,
  carvalho-et-al}. The following analysis investigates whether the
link between macro trends and the yield curve that underlies this
narrative is supported by the empirical evidence.

\section{Persistence in long-term yields from \texorpdfstring{$r^\ast_t$}{r*} and \texorpdfstring{$\pi^\ast_t$}{pi*}}
\label{sec:persistence}

If the trend components of inflation and the real interest rate play
an important role in driving interest rates, then these trends should
exhibit a close statistical relationship with long-term interest rates and
account, in particular, for most of the persistence of these rates. A natural starting point
for assessing this relationship is to consider simple regressions of
yields on the trend components. Table \ref{tab:reg}
reports the results for such regressions with three different
dependent variables: bond yields with 5 and 10 years maturity, and the
5-to-10-year forward rate. For each maturity, we estimate two versions
of the regressions (with standard errors calculated using the
Newey-West estimator with six lags). The first version has only a
constant and $\pi^\ast_t$ as regressors, which is the same regression
that CP estimated using their simple moving-average estimate of the
inflation trend (see their table 1). These regression results show
high $R^2$'s at all maturities and
$\pi^\ast_t$ coefficients that are just above one and highly
significant.\footnote{Our estimated coefficients on $\pi^\ast_t$ are
  somewhat higher than in CP because our measure of the inflation
  trend is less variable, though when $r^\ast_t$ is added, the
  estimated coefficients for $\pi^\ast_t$ decrease toward one.} CP
interpret these results as indicating that trend inflation drives the
level of yield curve. However, the results for the second regression
specification show that incorporating the real rate trend is also important. Indeed, with the
addition of $r^\ast_t$ to the regressions, both the inflation and real rate trends
coefficients are highly significant, and the regression $R^2$'s
increase a further 7 to 12 percentage points.

Taken at face value, these estimates suggest that changes in
$r^\ast_t$ along with fluctuations in $\pi^\ast_t$, are key sources of
variation in long-term interest rates.  The interpretation of these
results is complicated by the fact that all of the variables in the
regressions are highly persistent. Conventional asymptotic arguments,
which justify inference based on the Newey-West standard errors and
$R^2$'s in Table \ref{tab:reg}, are not valid if some of the variables
contain autoregressive roots close to or equal to one. For example,
under the assumptions of the model in Section \ref{sec:model}, these
roots are equal to one, and the static regressions in Table
\ref{tab:reg} estimate cointegrating relationships between long-term
interest rates, inflation, and real rates.\footnote{Much empirical
  work, for example, \cite{kpsw}, has documented the substantial
  persistence in nominal interest rates, inflation, and real interest
  rates. The main difference between our static regressions and the
  usual cointegration regressions in this context \citep[as in][for
  example]{rose} is that we use directly observable proxies for the
  trend components of $\pi_t$ and $r_t$.} If there is indeed such a
cointegrating relationship, then the regression provides
super-consistent estimates of the cointegrating vector, the $R^2$
converges to one, and conventional hypothesis tests are likely invalid
for inference about the coefficients \citep[e.g.,][Chapter
19]{hamilton}. Consequently, the regression results in Table
\ref{tab:reg}---although suggestive of the joint importance of
$r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$ for the determination of yields---cannot
provide definitive answers.

To provide more compelling statistical evidence that
our measures of $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$ capture the persistent
variation in interest rates, we examine the time series properties of
detrended long-term interest rates with one or both of the trend
components subtracted out. For the same three interest rates considered above,
Table \ref{tab:detrended} reports the standard deviation and two measures of
persistence: the estimated first-order autocorrelation coefficient,
$\hat{\rho}$, and the half-life, which
indicates the number of quarters until half of a given shock has died
out and is calculated as $\ln(0.5)/\ln(\hat{\rho})$.
For each interest rate, the table reports these statistics for five
different series: the level of the interest rate, the rate detrended by
simply subtracting out $\pi^\ast_t$ or $i^\ast_t$ (assuming unit coefficients on
these trends), and the detrended rate calculated as the
residuals from one of the two static detrending regressions in Table \ref{tab:reg}.
Several findings stand out: First, detrending with $r^\ast_t$ as well as
$\pi^\ast_t$ removes substantially more persistence, typically
reducing the half-life by about 40-50\%. That is, $\pi^\ast_t$ is
not the only important driver of interest rate persistence. Second, the detrended series are
substantially less variable and less persistent than the original
interest rate series. For example, shocks to the ten-year yield have a
half-life of about 5-1/2 years, whereas shocks to the difference between the
ten-year yield and $i^\ast_t$ have a half-life
of just under one year. Finally, there is little difference in the statistical
properties between series that are detrended using unit
coefficients and those that are detrended using estimated
coefficients, notably for the forward rate.

Unit root tests provide further evidence supporting detrending with \emph{both} $r^\ast_t$
and $\pi^\ast_t$. The last two columns of Table \ref{tab:detrended}
provide parametric Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) $t$-statistics
and non-parametric Phillips-Perron (PP) $Z_\alpha$ statistics, which examine
the persistence properties of these series by testing
the null hypothesis of a unit autoregressive root.\footnote{For the ADF
test, we include a constant and $k$ lagged difference in the test
regression, where $k$ is determined using the general-to-specific procedure
suggested by \cite{ng-perron-95}. We start with $k=4$ quarterly lags and
reduce the number of lags until the coefficient on the last lag is
significant at the ten percent level. For the PP test, we use a
Newey-West estimator of the long-run variance with four lags.
When the series under consideration is a residual from
an estimated cointegration regression, we don't include intercepts in
the ADF or PP regression equations and use the critical values provided by
\cite{phillips-ouliaris}, which depend on the number of regressors in
the cointegration equation.} These tests show strong evidence against the
unit root null for the series that are detrended with both
$\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$. By contrast, the unit root null is never rejected
at the 5 percent level for the original interest rate series or for
series that are detrended with just $\pi^\ast_t$. This evidence
strongly supports the use of $i^\ast_t = r^\ast_t + \pi^\ast_t$ when accounting for interest rate
persistence and understanding interest rate dynamics. Finally, when
detrending with both $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$, the rejections are at
least as strong for the series that are detrended using unit
coefficients as for the residuals from the static regressions,
consistent with the prediction of equation \eqref{eq:yields}.

These results have important implications for the debate about
the long-run Fisher effect, which posits a common trend for inflation and
interest rates with a unit coefficient (leaving aside tax
considerations). A sizeable literature has tested this hypothesis with
mixed results, often estimating an inflation coefficient that
is larger than one (see the references in footnote \ref{fn:fisher}).  We
have provided evidence that long-term interest rates contain two trend
components but that the series $y_t - \pi^\ast_t - r^\ast_t$ is
stationary, consistent with the prediction of our model. Our results
thus provide strong support for a long-run Fisher effect if shifts
in the equilibrium real rate are taken into account.
The importance of time variation in $r^\ast_t$ can explain
why past research has generally been unable to find a stable
relationship between nominal interest rates and inflation, going back
to \cite{rose} and recently summarized by
\cite{neely-rapach}. Under the unit root assumption, ignoring
$r_t^\ast$ as a trend component, by regressing interest rates only on $\pi^\ast_t$ (or $\pi_t$), leads to a
misspecified cointegration relationship as the residual contains the
trend $r^\ast_t$. In such a situation, it will be very difficult
to uncover the Fisher effect. By contrast, including both $r^\ast_t$
and $\pi^\ast_t$, we obtain clear,
unambiguous results: the trend components of inflation and the real
rate are related to interest rates exactly as standard finance theory
predicts with a long-run Fisher effect and the two trends
together capture a large share of the persistence in long-term
interest rates.

\section{Forecasting interest rates with \texorpdfstring{$r^\ast_t$}{r*} and \texorpdfstring{$\pi^\ast_t$}{pi*}}
\label{sec:forecasting}

The previous section illustrated the strong persistence of interest rates and
the close link between that persistence and measures of the inflation trend,
$\pi^\ast_t$, and the equilibrium real rate, $r^\ast_t$. Here, we provide
complementary evidence based on interest rate forecasts.

We forecast the five- and ten-year yields and the five-to-ten-year forward rate. At each
point in time, starting in 1976:Q1 (at $t=20$) when five years of data are
available, we forecast each interest rate, $y_t$, at horizons from $h=1$
to $h=40$ quarters. The benchmark model in the literature is a
driftless random walk, i.e., the forecast
$\hat{y}_{t+h} = y_t$ for all $h$. This benchmark is denoted in the
results as Method 1. The two alternative
forecast specifications assume that interest rates mean-revert to a
time-varying endpoint $\hat{\imath}_t$. Of these, Method 2 assumes that this
endpoint is only driven by the inflation trend, i.e., that
$\hat{\imath}_t$ equals $\pi^\ast_t$ plus a constant. We estimate this
constant recursively as the mean of $y_\tau - \pi^\ast_\tau$, using
observations from $\tau=1$ to $\tau=t$.\footnote{We have found in
  additional, unreported results that forecasts which assume that this
  constant is zero perform much worse than this method.} Method 3
instead assumes that the endpoint is
$\hat{\imath}_t = i^\ast_t = \pi^\ast_t + r^\ast_t$. For both shifting endpoint forecast methods, the
speed of mean-reversion is recursively estimated as the first-order
autocorrelation coefficient of $y_t - \hat{\imath}_t$. Denoting this
coefficient as $\hat{\rho}_t$, the forecasts for Methods 2 and 3 are
constructed as
$\hat{y}_{t+h} = \hat{\rho}_t^h y_t + (1-\hat{\rho}_t^h) \hat{\imath}_t$.
The exact value of $\hat{\rho}_t$, or even the methodology for determining
it, affects short-horizon forecasts but was inconsequential for our main results.

Table \ref{tab:yield_forecasts} reports the results of this
forecasting exercise in terms of root-mean-squared errors (RMSEs) and
mean-absolute errors (MAEs), in percentage points. We also calculate
$p$-values for tests of equal finite-sample forecast accuracy
using the approach of \cite{diebold-mariano} (DM).\footnote{Following
common use, we construct the DM test with a rectangular window
for the long-run variance and the small-sample adjustment of
\cite{harvey-leybourne-newbold}. Monte Carlo evidence in
  \cite{clark-mccracken} indicates that this test has good size in finite
  samples. However, for very long forecast horizons there are of
  course only few non-overlapping observations in our sample, so the
  $p$-values are subject to substantial uncertainty.} We calculate these DM
$p$-values, using standard normal critical values, for
one-sided tests of whether forecasts using the endpoint $i^\ast_t$ (Method 3) improve upon random walk forecasts (Method 1) and upon forecasts that use
only $\pi^\ast_t$ for the endpoint (Method 2). We find that Method 3
leads to substantial and highly significant gains in forecast
accuracy at long horizons. Such gains are evident for both
RMSEs and MAEs, but are larger and more strongly significant for
absolute-error loss. For example, when forecasting the ten-year yield
five years ahead, using the information in $i^\ast_t$ lowers the RMSE by over 25\%
relative to the random walk forecast, an improvement that is
significant at the five-percent level, while the MAE drops by
more than 40\% and is significant at the one percent level. Using $i^\ast_t$
for forecasts also improves upon Method 2, which does not use $r^\ast_t$, by a
magnitude that is typically large and
statistically significant.

This long-horizon forecast exercise thus confirms that interest rates
exhibit reversion to the time-varying endpoint $i^\ast_t$, as predicted by the theory of Section
\ref{sec:model}.\footnote{The model in Section \ref{sec:model} implies that
  the endpoint equals a maturity-specific constant plus $i^\ast_t$,
  but our results show that it is not necessary to try to estimate and
  include this constant in the endpoint to obtain accurate forecasts.}
Earlier research, such as \cite{dijk-etal}, has found
that when forecasting interest rates it is beneficial to link long-run
projections of interest rates to long-run expectations of
inflation. Our new result shows that including $r^\ast_t$ along
with $\pi^\ast_t$ improves on long-horizon interest rate
forecasting to an even greater degree. That is, accounting only
for the time variation in $\pi^\ast_t$ is insufficient, as it is important
to include $r^\ast_t$ in understanding
yield curve dynamics. Furthermore, while earlier
authors ran regressions of the
level of interest rates on long-run inflation expectations to scale $\pi^\ast_t$
for forecasting, our results show
that no such scaling or estimation is necessary for accurate long-range
forecasts if the endpoint is simply taken as $i^\ast_t$.\footnote{Our approach could easily be extended to jointly forecast the
whole yield curve as in \cite{diebold-li} and \cite{dijk-etal}, by simply forecasting the
Nelson-Siegel level factor in the same fashion that we have forecast
each individual interest rate above.}

Many studies have documented that it is difficult to beat the random
walk model when forecasting bond yields, which reflects
the extreme persistence of interest rates.\footnote{Prominent
  examples include \cite{duffee02} and \cite{diebold-li}; see
  \cite{duffee-handbook-forecasting} for a review of this
  literature.} But our results show that one can obtain
better forecasts if one accounts for the source of this
persistence. Our use of empirical proxies for the macroeconomic
trends inherent in interest rates leads to substantially
better long-term forecasts than the random walk model.
%This finding does not imply that either
%interest rates or their trend components are truly I(1) time series, but
%instead reflects the fact that when forecasting highly persistent but
%possibly stationary series, it often helps predictive accuracy to
%model such series as containing a unit root.

\section{Predicting bond returns with \texorpdfstring{$r^\ast_t$}{r*} and \texorpdfstring{$\pi^\ast_t$}{pi*}}
\label{sec:returns}

We now turn to the role of macroeconomic trends in predicting bond
returns. In the analysis of CP, proxies for the
inflation trend have significant predictive power for annual
excess bond returns, above and beyond the information contained in the
yield curve itself. Since $r^\ast_t$ also is an important trend
driving long-term interest rates, we address the natural
question of what role it plays in such predictive regressions.

We predict excess returns for holding periods of one quarter and four
quarters. The excess return for a holding period of $h$ quarters for
a bond with maturity $n$ is calculated as
\[
  rx_{t, t+h}^{(n)} = p_{t+h}^{(n-h)} - p_t^{(n)} - h y_t^{(h)} =
  -(n-h)y_{t+h}^{(n-h)} + n y_t^{(n)} - h y_t^{(h)}.
\]
Our long-term bond yields are available only at annual maturities, so
we calculate one-quarter returns with the usual approximation
$y_{t+1}^{(n-1)} \approx y_{t+1}^{(n)}$. Our dependent variable is the
average excess return for all bonds with two to 15 years
maturity.\footnote{CP focused on annual holding periods and used
a weighted average that downweights
  longer-term bonds. Our use of a simple average made no material
  difference to the results and is more common in
  this literature. Our sample period is similar to
  the one considered in CP but ends in 2015 instead of 2011.}
We begin with three specifications of the predictive
regressions: The first includes a constant and the first three
principal components (PCs) of yields. This common baseline regression
is motivated by work going back to \cite{famabliss} and
\cite{campbellshiller91} that showed there is information in the
yield curve itself, and in particular in its slope (PC2), about
expected bond returns. The second specification adds $\pi^\ast_t$ and
is closely related to the specification with an inflation trend
that was estimated by CP. The third specification also includes
$r^\ast_t$ in order to simultaneously capture the effects of both macroeconomic trends
in the regression.

The top panel of Table \ref{tab:returns} reports the estimation
results for the full sample. We calculate White's heteroskedasticity-robust standard
errors for the case of one-quarter returns and Newey-West
standard errors with six lags for the four-quarter returns (since
the overlap introduces serial correlations in the error term). Our
results replicate CP's main finding, namely that inclusion
of the inflation trend raises the predictive power quite substantially
compared to a regression that only includes yield-curve
information, and that both the inflation trend and the level of yields
(PC1) appear highly significant. However, adding $r^\ast_t$ to the
regressions leads to further impressive
gains in predictive power. For both one-quarter and
four-quarter returns, the $R^2$ increases substantially, the
coefficients and $t$-statistics for $\pi^\ast_t$ and PC1 rise, and the
coefficient on $r^\ast_t$ itself is large and highly significant.
Interestingly, the coefficient on $r^\ast_t$ is about as large as
the coefficient on $\pi^\ast_t$, which confirms the prediction
from our theoretical model that these two trends play similar roles
in determining interest rates.

It is well known that these kinds of predictive regressions for bond returns raise
some knotty econometric issues. \cite{bauer-hamilton} show that the
small-sample inference in such cases is particularly problematic when the predictors
are highly persistent, like interest rates and our macro trends. They
propose a parametric bootstrap procedure to carry out robust inference
in such cases. It tests the null hypothesis that only the information
in the yield curve is useful for predicting excess returns, and it can
accurately gauge the statistical significance of additional proposed
predictors. Following their recommendation, we calculate bootstrap
small-sample $p$-values for the coefficients on $\pi^\ast_t$ and
$r^\ast_t$. Our bootstrap simulates yields from a simple VAR(1) factor
model and the additional predictors from a separate VAR(1) model, so
that the null hypothesis---that macro trends are unimportant---holds
by construction.\footnote{Estimates of the
  VAR coefficients are bias-corrected to more accurately capture the high persistence of
  interest rates and the trend components.} The predictive regression
is estimated in each bootstrap sample and the $t$-statistics for the
additional predictors are recorded. With this small-sample
distribution of the test statistics in hand, $p$-values are calculated
as the fraction of simulated samples in which the $t$-statistic is at
least as large (in absolute value) as the $t$-statistic in the actual
data. These $p$-values, reported in squared brackets in Table
\ref{tab:returns}, indicate that both of our trends are statistically
significant even when we account for small-sample econometric
concerns.

In the subsample starting in 1985, the inflation trend is not
statistically significant when included on its own according to
the small-sample $p$-values.\footnote{This result is consistent with \cite{bauer-hamilton}
  who also found that in a subsample starting in 1985 the inflation trend is only
  marginally significant.}  Only when we add our measure of the equilibrium real
rate do both trends matter for bond risk premia; the coefficients on
$\pi^\ast_t$ and PC1 more than double, the $R^2$ increases
substantially, and the coefficients on $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$ are
statistically significant. These results confirm our intuition from
Figure \ref{fig:data1} that the real-rate trend has gained in
importance over time relative to the trend in
inflation. Therefore, empirical analysis of long-term
interest rates implies that the trend in the real
interest rate is as important as, and recently more important
than, the trend in inflation.\footnote{In additional, unreported
  results we have found that the predictive gains from including
  $r^\ast_t$ are particularly large during the early 2000s when both
  $r^\ast_t$ and long-term interest rates decreased while long-run
  inflation expectations where anchored close to two percent.}

In the presence of persistent predictors, it is generally
difficult to interpret the magnitude of $R^2$ as a measure of
predictive accuracy, because even predictors that are irrelevant in
population can substantially increase $R^2$ in small
samples \citep{bauer-hamilton}. By using the
bootstrap to avoid this pitfall, we generate small-sample distributions of $R^2$ under
the null hypothesis that only yields have predictive power, and
interpret the statistics obtained in the actual data by comparing them
to the quantiles of these distributions. Table
\ref{tab:returns_cycles} reports this comparison for predictive
regressions of annual excess returns for the three specifications we
have considered so far, as well as for two additional ones that will be discussed
below. Adding $\pi^\ast_t$ to the regression increases $R^2$ by 20
percentage points, but this is only barely higher than the upper end
of the 95\%-bootstrap interval, which suggests that under the null
hypothesis it would not be too uncommon to observe an increase in $R^2$ of
up to 19 percentage points. In contrast, adding $r^\ast_t$ increases $R^2$ to 54\%,
and the increase relative to the yields-only specification of 31
percentage points is much higher than what is plausible under
the null hypothesis. In the post-1985 subsample, the increase in $R^2$
from only adding $\pi^\ast_t$ is not statistically significant, whereas
the increase of 29 percentage points from adding both trends is
strongly significant.

CP defined ``interest rate cycles'' as the de-trended component in
interest rates, which they denoted as $c^{(n)}_t$, and showed that these cycles captured the predictive
power in interest rates and the inflation trend for future bond
returns. They estimated these interest rate cycles as the residuals of
regressions of interest rates on their measure of the inflation
trend. Our results here and in the previous sections indicate that a
better estimate of the cycle can be obtained by incorporating both an
inflation trend and a real rate trend. Furthermore, our evidence in
Section \ref{sec:persistence} supporting a cointegration vector
between interest rates and the macro trends of $(1, -1, -1)$ suggests
that interest cycles ($c^{(n)}_t$ in CP's notation) should be calculated simply as
$y_t^{(n)} - \pi^\ast_t - r^\ast_t$, as prescribed by our simple
no-arbitrage model in Section \ref{sec:model}. In addition we also consider
cycles that are calculated as yields detrended by only $\pi^\ast_t$,
i.e., $y_t^{(n)} - \pi_t^\ast$, in order to understand the separate importance
of both trend components. Figure \ref{fig:cycles} compares these two measures of
interest rate cycles by plotting for each case the average cycle
across yields of maturities from two to 15 years (as in CP). The cycle
that is calculated by detrending only with $\pi^\ast_t$ still contains
an important trend component, as evident in the substantial decline of
about four percentage points from the level prevailing in the 1990s to
the end of the sample. The cycle measure that also accounts for
changes in the equilibrium real interest rate does not exhibit this
trend. Instead, it exhibits cyclical behavior with clear mean
reversion.

Furthermore, in the spirit of CP, we investigate the use of interest rate cycles,
i.e., detrended yields, in predictive regressions for bond
returns. The first three rows of Table \ref{tab:returns_cycles}
summarize our earlier results from the regression of excess returns on
yield PCs alone, PCs jointly with $\pi^\ast_t$, and PCs with both
trends. The bottom two rows provide results for predictions using
interest rate cycles. In this case the predictors are the three PCs
of the detrended yield curve. Table
\ref{tab:returns_cycles} shows that using PCs of yields that are
detrended only by $\pi^\ast_t$ increases $R^2$ by 10 percentage points
relative to the baseline regression with three PCs of yields that are
not detrended. But using PCs of yields that are detrended by both
macro trends increases $R^2$ by 20 percentage points. The difference
is even more striking in the later subsample that starts in 1985: $R^2$
increases only seven percentage points when detrending with
only $\pi^\ast_t$ but 28 percentage points when detrending with both
$\pi_t^\ast$ and $r^\ast_t$. We again calculate small-sample
distributions of these test statistics under the null hypothesis by
running the exact same regressions in bootstrapped samples. For the
later subsample, the increase in $R^2$ is insignificant for
$\pi^\ast_t$-detrending but strongly significant when we use the
correct detrending using both macro trends as prescribed by
no-arbitrage theory.

An intriguing final issue is why the information in $\pi^\ast_t$ and
$r^\ast_t$ is not spanned by the yield curve. Both reduced-form and
structural/equilibrium models of the term structure of interest rates
generally imply that the yield curve contains all (i.e., spans) the
relevant information for predicting future yields and bond returns
\citep{jls,duffee-handbook-forecasting}. The apparent conflict of this
prediction with the empirical evidence of unspanned macro risks
in bond returns is an important current issue in macro-finance
\citep{ludvigson-ng-rfs,jps,cieslak-povala}.  CP and
\cite{bauer-rudebusch-spanning} suggest that measurement error, which
breaks spanning, can reconcile the models with the
data. \cite{bauer-hamilton} demonstrate that much of the apparent
evidence for unspanned macro risks is substantially weaker and partly
spurious once small-sample problems are accounted for, as the presence of
trending, persistent predictors renders conventional tests of the
spanning hypothesis unreliable. While these econometric
issues suggest that the evidence on the predictive power of
macroeconomic trends should be taken with a grain of salt, there are
possible complementary explanations for this phenomenon. We use
observable proxies for trends and have the benefit of hindsight, but
estimation of the trend components of time series is fraught with a
large amount of uncertainty, and it is difficult to learn about trends
in real time \citep{clark-kozicki}. Because forecasters and investors
are bound to learn slowly about changes in trends, and because they
may disagree about the trend, bond prices may not fully
incorporate the evolution of macroeconomic trends. A related issue is
the rational expectations assumption that underlies all hypothesis
tests about bond returns using time series data. The wedge between
subjective (e.g., survey-based) and objective (statistical)
expectations of interest rates and bond returns---documented by
\cite{piazzesi-salomao-schneider}, among others---could cause
statistical findings of unspanned risks that were not in fact a
feature of subjective risk premia of investors at the time.  More work
is needed to better understand how these issues relate to apparent
failures of the spanning hypothesis and the incremental predictive
power of macro trend estimates for bond returns that we document here.

In sum, accounting for the persistent components of yields is
important for understanding return predictability. We find that
$r^\ast_t$ has strong incremental predictive power for bond returns,
about on par with the importance of $\pi^\ast_t$ as a predictor. This
suggests that for estimation of bond risk premia it is crucial to
account for not only the inflation trend but also for the
equilibrium real rate.

\section{Calculating the term premium with
  \texorpdfstring{$r^\ast_t$}{r*} and
  \texorpdfstring{$\pi^\ast_t$}{pi*}}
\label{sec:tp}

Our evidence supports the view that for modeling
the yield curve, forecasting interest rates, or predicting bond
returns, it is important to account for movements in the
trend components $r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$. Accordingly,
these trends should also be integral for estimation of the
term premium in long-term interest rates, which we denote as $TP_t^{(n)}$.
This alternative measure of bond risk is defined as the
difference between holding an $n$-month bond to maturity or facing
a sequence of 1-period rates over the same period:
\[ TP_t^{(n)} = y_t^{(n)} - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} E_t
  y^{(1)}_{t+j}. \]
Our earlier results show that the expected path of future short rates
should not be assumed to return to a constant mean but to a shifting endpoint
$i^\ast_t = r^\ast_t + \pi^\ast_t$. Here, we introduce a methodology to incorporate information
about $r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$ in the estimation of the term premium and
compare the results to a conventional estimate.

Decompositions of long-term interest rates into short-rate
expectations and term premia are commonly obtained from a variety of
dynamic models ranging from simple factor models to no-arbitrage term
structure models. We employ the former in this section, by estimating a
time-series process for yield curve PCs and fitting the cross section of
yields using the PC loadings.\footnote{The results from such a factor model
  will be essentially identical to those from a model that imposes
  maximally-flexible no-arbitrage restrictions on the loadings of
  yields on risk factors \citep{duffee-forecasting, jls}. Still, \cite{cp08}
  and \cite{bauer-rrp} emphasized that restricting the prices of risk can
  let the cross-sectional behavior of yields help pin down the
  time-series specification for yields, which could be relevant for developing
  no-arbitrage models that incorporate our findings.} Short-rate expectations are then
calculated from the VAR forecasts of the yield PCs and the PC loadings
of the short rate. Our model uses three PCs calculated from 15 Treasury yields
with maturities from one year to 15 years over an estimation sample
from 1971:Q4 to 2007:Q4. We
omit the period of near-zero short-rates beginning in 2008, since the
lower bound on nominal interest rates poses problems for linear factor
models \citep{bauer-rudebusch-zlb}.

To provide a conventional baseline measure of the term premium, we
estimate a first-order annual VAR(1) in quarterly observations using
the first three PCs of interest rates.\footnote{That is,
  the PCs are regressed on an intercept and the one-year lagged
  values of the PCs, a specification motivated by the evidence of \cite{cp05} that the
  dynamics of risk premia are more evident at the annual frequency
  \citep[see also][]{cp08}.}
In line with the underlying structure of the majority of no-arbitrage
models, this is a stationary VAR. For example, \cite{cp08} estimated
an annual VAR(1) for five interest rates in monthly observations, and
our results closely parallel theirs. In the top-left panel of Figure
\ref{fig:tp}, we plot the model-implied expectations of the one-year
yield at different horizons, as well as the observed one-year
yield. As emphasized by \cite{cp08}, stationary VARs for the levels of
interest rates imply forecasts that quickly revert to the
unconditional mean of the short rate (which is 6.5 percent). The top-right
panel of Figure \ref{fig:tp} shows the five-to-ten-year forward rate
with its expectations and term premium components. (Results for the ten-year
yield are qualitatively similar.) Not surprisingly, in light of the
behavior of model-implied forecasts, the expectations component is
very stable, hovering around the short-rate mean. Therefore, the term
premium, as the residual component, has to account for
the trend in the long-term interest rate since the 1980s.
As argued by \cite{kim-orphanides} and \cite{brw2}, such behavior of
expectations and term premium components appears at odds with observed
trends in survey-based expectations \citep{kozicki-tinsley} and the
cyclical behavior of risk premia in asset prices
\citep{campbell-cochrane}.

To incorporate a trend component into forecasts of the yield curve, we
instead model detrended yields as a stationary VAR. That is, we
subtract $i^\ast_t$ from each yield as called
for by the evidence in Sections
\ref{sec:persistence}--\ref{sec:returns}, calculate three PCs of
detrended yields, and again estimate an annual VAR(1). We calculate
the term premium by forecasting the detrended interest rates and adding the
trend back in to obtain the expected path of future short rates.
The bottom two panels of Figure \ref{fig:tp} show the implications of
this model for expectations and the term premium. As the forecast
horizon increases, short-rate expectations
approach the trend component $i^\ast_t$
instead of the unconditional mean of the short rate. Consequently, the expectations
component reflects the movements in $i^\ast_t$ and accounts for the
low-frequency movements in the long-term forward rate. The term
premium, by contrast, behaves in a cyclical fashion with no
discernible trend. The drop in the forward rate from its average during 1980-1982 to
its average during 2005-2007 was about 7.5 percentage points. In the conventional VAR
of interest rates, the estimated term premium accounts for over 80\% of
this decline. In contrast, the VAR with detrended yields attributes only
a quarter of this decline to the term premium. This
stark difference demonstrates how
accounting for the slow-moving trend component in interest rates
fundamentally alters our understanding of the driving forces of
long-term interest rates.

This model---a VAR for interest rate cycles conditional on estimates
of the trend $i_t^\ast$---provides a simple but
effective way to account for a common trend (i.e., shifting endpoints)
in bond yields. In addition to estimation of the term premium, it
could be useful in related applications, such as in forecasting the
entire yield curve jointly, or for calculating of expected returns for
any bond and holding period. While it does not impose no-arbitrage, the representation is consistent
with the key predictions of our no-arbitrage model in Section
\ref{sec:model} regarding the role of time-variation in $i^\ast_t$ for bond yields.

\section{Variance contributions of \texorpdfstring{$r^\ast_t$}{r*} and
  \texorpdfstring{$\pi^\ast_t$}{pi*}}
\label{sec:horizons}

Finally, we compare the size of fluctuations in
$r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$ with those of long-term nominal
bond yields. \cite{duffee-inflation-risk} finds that news about future inflation is generally small
relative to the innovations in nominal yields.
We interpret his results in the context of our theoretical
model and extend them empirically
to consider movements in both $r^\ast_t$ and $\pi^\ast_t$ and
at horizons greater than just one quarter.

The variance ratio used by Duffee divides the variance of quarterly innovations to average inflation
expectations over $n$ periods by the variance of innovations to the
bond yield for maturity $n$:
\[ VR_1^{(n)} = \frac{Var\left((E_t-E_{t-1})n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n
  \pi_{t+i}\right)}{Var\left((E_t-E_{t-1}) y_t^{(n)}\right)}.
\]
We generalize this measure to allow for
a longer time span to calculate the change in expectations,
\[
  VR_h^{(n)} = \frac{Var\left((E_t-E_{t-h})n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n
    \pi_{t+i}\right)}{Var\left((E_t-E_{t-h}) y_t^{(n)}\right)},
\]
so the variances are calculated for the $h$-period innovation
(where a period will remain a quarter).
Our theoretical model from Section \ref{sec:model} implies
analytical expressions for these variance ratios. For one-period
and $h$-period innovations, respectively, they are
\begin{eqnarray*}
  VR_1^{(n)} &=& \frac{\sigma_\xi^2 + a_c(n) \sigma_u^2}{\sigma_\xi^2
                 + a_c(n) \sigma_u^2 + \sigma_\eta^2 + a_g(n)
                 \sigma_v^2 + \left(\frac{B_n^x}{n}\right)^2
                 \sigma_w^2}, \\
  VR_h^{(n)} &=& \frac{h\sigma_\xi^2 + a_c(n)b_c(h) \sigma_u^2}{h\sigma_\xi^2 + a_c(n) b_c(h) \sigma_u^2 + h \sigma_\eta^2 + a_g(n) b_g(h) \sigma_v^2 + \left(\frac{B_n^x}{n}\right)^2 b_x(h) \sigma_w^2},\\
             && a_i(n) = \left(\frac{1-\phi_i^n}{n(1-\phi_i)}\right)^2, \quad b_i(h)
                = \frac{1-\phi_i^{2h}}{1-\phi_i^2}, \quad i = c, g, x.
\end{eqnarray*}
These expressions help elucidate the factors determining the variance ratios.

An important result of Duffee's analysis is that even for long-term
bonds, $VR_1^{(n)}$ appears to be surprisingly small. That is,
one-period changes in expected average future inflation are much less
variable than one-period surprises in long-term bond yields.
This result can be understood by noting that through the
lens of our model
\[
\underset{n \rightarrow \infty}{\lim} VR_1^{(n)} =
\frac{\sigma_\xi^2}{\sigma_\xi^2 + \sigma_\eta^2 + \left(
    \frac{\lambda_{\pi^\ast x} + \lambda_{r^\ast
        x}}{1-\phi_x}\right)^2 \sigma_w^2 }.
\]
This ratio will be small if shocks to the equilibrium real rate ($\eta_t$) and to
the risk-premium factor ($w_t$) make more important contributions to yield innovations than shocks
to the inflation trend ($\xi_t$). One plausible interpretation of Duffee's
finding is that at a quarterly frequency the trend in inflation
moves much less than the term premium component of long-term interest
rates. The term premium is a catch-all
component of price movements due to a
variety of factors including changes in risk-sentiment and ``animal spirits'' not attributable to
changes in real-rate and inflation expectations.  This interpretation is
consistent with additional evidence in Duffee's paper on the role of
the term premium and with a large body of evidence on excess
volatility of interest rates, going back to
\cite{shiller-79}.

Another way to understand the link between inflation expectations
and bond yields is to consider longer horizons $h$. In the limit, this
generalization of the variance ratio appears promising because
\[
\underset{h \rightarrow \infty}{\lim} VR_h^{(n)} =
\frac{\sigma_\xi^2}{\sigma_\xi^2 + \sigma_\eta^2},
\]
so asymptotically, this inflation variance ratio is only affected by changes
in the trend components. Changes in term premia become irrelevant at
very low frequencies if, as in our model, the risk premium factor $x_t$
is stationary. Of course, empirical variance ratios for large $h$
do have the drawback that as $h$ increases, so does the overlap of
observations; therefore, we quickly lose degrees of
freedom and precision in our estimates. However, the profile of variance
ratios across horizons should give us additional insights about interest
rate dynamics, even if the maximum horizon is severely limited in practice by
data availability.

Estimation of the these variance ratios requires expectations of inflation
and interest rates. Like Duffee we consider survey-based inflation
expectations (in our measure of $\pi^\ast_t$) and
martingale interest rate forecasts. But instead of modeling the
inflation process we approximate inflation news by the change in
$\pi^\ast_t$. This allows us to calculate the simplified variance ratio
\[
\widetilde{VR}_h^{(n)} = \frac{Var\left(\Delta_h \pi^\ast_t\right)}{Var\left( \Delta_h
  y_t^{(n)}\right)}, \qquad \Delta_h z_t = z_t - z_{t-h}.
\]
For any given $n$ and $h$, $\widetilde{VR}_h^{(n)}$ differs from
$VR_h^{(n)}$ because the variances in the simplified ratio include movements
that were anticipated at $t-h$. However, in many cases, these differences
are likely to be small, in particular for longer time spans of the
innovations/changes, since in the limit
\[
\underset{h \rightarrow \infty}{\lim} \widetilde{VR}_h^{(n)} =
\frac{\sigma_\xi^2}{\sigma_\xi^2 + \sigma_\eta^2} = \underset{h
  \rightarrow \infty}{\lim} VR_h^{(n)}.
\]
Thus, for low-frequency movements, the two inflation variance ratios
are asymptotically identical.

Figure \ref{fig:vr} shows estimates of $\widetilde{VR}_h^{(n)}$ for
changes from one quarter to $h=40$ quarters in the five-year yield,
the ten-year yield, and the 5-to-10-year forward rate. This shows the
relative importance of fluctuations in long-run inflation
expectations. Similarly, we also calculate these variance ratios for
the contribution of changes in the real-rate trend, $r^\ast_t$, and in
the overall trend component $i^\ast_t = \pi^\ast_t + r^\ast_t$, simply
by replacing the variance in the numerator of
$\widetilde{VR}_h^{(n)}$.

For the inflation trend, we find that one-quarter variance ratios are
around 0.1. This result is consistent with Duffee's findings and
suggests that changes in the inflation trend play a small role for
variation in yields at the quarterly frequency. At lower frequencies,
however, the relative variability of the inflation trend
increases. The point estimates of the $\pi^\ast_t$-variance ratio
quickly rise with the horizon, and for $h=40$ reach a magnitude of
around 0.3. This shows that inflation expectations are of substantial
importance for movements in bond yields once we shift the focus from
month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter variation and look at lower
frequencies changes over several years, which are arguably more relevant
for long-term bond investors.

The variance ratio for changes in the real-rate trend, i.e.,
$Var(\Delta_h r^\ast_t)/Var(\Delta_h y_t)$, is much lower than for
inflation, remaining below 0.1 even at long
horizons. This is unsurprising in light of Figure \ref{fig:data1},
which shows that over the full sample the movements in $r^\ast_t$ were
substantially less pronounced than movements in long-term interest
rates and the inflation trend.\footnote{This finding may partly reflect
our use of an average of different estimates for $r^\ast_t$---some of
the individual estimates exhibit distinctly more volatility.} Of
course, this perspective of unconditional
variances should not be taken to conclude that changes in the
equilibrium real rate are unimportant for interest rate dynamics,
given the ample evidence in Sections
\ref{sec:persistence}--\ref{sec:returns} of the crucial role of
$r^\ast_t$ for modeling and forecasting interest
rates. Furthermore, in more recent subsamples, variance ratios should
suggest that $r^\ast_t$ has become a more important driver of changes in
long-term interest rates.

To assess the overall importance of the trend components in interest
rates, we consider variance ratios for $i^\ast_t$, i.e.,
$Var(\Delta_h i^\ast_t)/Var(\Delta_h y_t)$. Confidence intervals are
obtained using the asymptotic distribution of the sample variances and
the delta method. To account for persistence in conditional variances,
Newey-West estimates of long-run variances are used.\footnote{We use
  12 quarterly lags for all long-run variance estimates as indicated
  by the automatic lag selection procedure of Newey and West. These
  confidence intervals may understate the true sampling variability
  due to the small number of non-overlapping observations, which
  decreases the reliability of the asymptotic approximations.}  Figure
\ref{fig:vr} shows that while the sampling uncertainty around the
variance ratios for changes in $i^\ast_t$ is substantial we can be
reasonably confident that these variance ratios increase from below
0.15 to a range of around 0.25 to 0.4, depending on the maturity of
the interest rate. The highest levels are reached for the 5-to-10-year
forward rate---the confidence interval at $h=40$ extends from about
0.3 to 0.4---which is consistent with the notion that distant forward
rates are more strongly affected by the trend components.

While our theoretical model implies that the variance ratios for $i^\ast_t$ approach one
for sufficiently large $h$, our estimates top out around
0.4. One possible explanation is
that we are simply not capturing the trend component with sufficient
accuracy. Although we have provided
ample evidence that our trend proxies are closely linked to the
low-frequency movements in interest rates, the true trend components might be more (or
less) variable than our measures. Additionally, we may not be able to consider
large enough $h$ given the available data sample. Finally,
it may be that the risk-premium
factor itself is sufficiently persistent that it drives
interest rate variation at such low frequencies.

To shed further light on this topic,
it is useful to consider not only the direct contribution of changes
in the trend to changes in interest rates, but also indirect
contributions, due to covariance terms. In Table \ref{tab:vr}, we
report the variances of changes in interest rates, in the trend
component $i^\ast_t$, and in the cycle components $y_t -
i^\ast_t$. The variance of yield changes can be decomposed as follows:
\[
Var(\Delta_h y_t) = Var(\Delta_h i^\ast_t) + Var(\Delta_h y_t -
\Delta_h i^\ast_t) + 2 Cov(\Delta_h i^\ast_t, \Delta_h y_t -
\Delta_h i^\ast_t).
\]
The first term captures the direct contribution of trends, whereas the
last term captures the their indirect contribution to movements in
yields. Table \ref{tab:vr} reports all three components. In the data,
the contribution of the covariance is small at short horizons, but
substantial at long horizons. The two last rightmost columns of Table
\ref{tab:vr} report the same variance ratio shown in Figure
\ref{fig:vr} along with a ratio that also includes the covariance
contribution---the indirect effects---in the numerator. This second
ratio rises to over 0.7 with horizon, which suggests that the
cycle component accounts for less than 30\% of the variance
of interest rate changes at low frequencies.\footnote{Note that our theoretical
  model, which assumed that shocks to trend and cycle
  components are uncorrelated, would need to be generalized to
  provide a model-based interpretation of these results.} These
estimates confirm that after accounting for both direct and
indirect effects, changes in macro trends play an important
role in low-frequency movements in interest rates.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have provided new evidence that interest rates and risk pricing are
substantially driven by time variation in the trend in inflation and the equilibrium real
rate of interest. Our empirical approach employed existing
estimates of these macroeconomic trends to investigate
this relationship from a variety of perspectives. We showed
that accounting for these trend components can help understand, model, and forecast long-term interest rates
and bond returns. Our results confirm the predictions of no-arbitrage
theory for the links between macroeconomic trends and the yield curve,
and they demonstrate that these links are quantitatively important.

Our findings open up several avenues for future research. Most
importantly, they demonstrate the advantages of yield curve models
that allow for slow-moving changes in the long-run mean of
inflation and the real rate. This applies to both reduced-form
no-arbitrage models as well as to more structural, equilibrium models
of the yield curve. The purpose of specifying and estimating such
models is typically to understand bond risk premia/term premia and
risk compensation. Calculating the required long-run expectations without
accounting for changes in the underlying trends is likely to give
misleading results for risk premia. To avoid this pitfall we recommend
that shifting macro trends should be incorporated in future models of
the term structure of interest rates.

Our analysis should be viewed as a first step in the integration of
macroeconomic trends into yield curve modeling. We took estimates of
macroeconomic trends from surveys and models and treated them as
data. While this is a useful starting point, future research will have
to investigate the role of model and estimation uncertainty for the
links between macro trends and the yield curve. Another important
additional dimension to consider is potential change over time in the
relative importance of the macroeconomic trends in accounting for
long-run interest rates. For example, it is well known in empirical
macroeconomics \citep[e.g.,][]{stock-watson-ucsv} that the trend
component of inflation was much more variable in the 1970s and 1980s than
in more recent decades. This raises the question how our (mostly
unconditional) results are affected by taking a conditional
perspective. Furthermore, this suggests that incorporating not only
macroeconomic trends but also stochastic volatility in these trend
components will be useful for term structure modeling.
