\section{Summary}
\label{sec:org6d5afb8}

This paper analyzes the data from FOMC's Summary of Economic
Projections (SEP), focusing on the median and dispersion of the projection for the future
policy rate. First, the evolution of this data is described. Second, a
non-linear model is used to fit the median dots on each date. Third,
the projections are regressed on macro variables. The regression
results include  stronger and more significant response coefficients to unemployment than
inflation. 

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:orge92c3ff}

The SEP releases provide a valuable new source of information not only
to market participants but also for researchers that are trying to
better understand the preferences and reactions of policy-makers to
the changing macroeconomic environment. At the zero lower bound, this
can be particularly useful since the federal funds rate is stuck near
zero and projections of its future evolution become even more relevant
than during normal times. The current paper uses this new data, but
does not provide any new insights about central bank behavior or this
particular historic episodes. Part of the analysis is just
descriptive, while the regression analysis suffers from substantial
problems that likely invalidate the results. In the following I
describe the problems in more detail and suggest some possible
remedies.

\begin{itemize}
\item The only substantial empirical analysis of the paper are the
regression results in Section 5, since the rest of the results is
purely descriptive and does not add any significant value or
insights relative to the observed behavior of the SEP. The first
problem with these regressions is that projections of future
monetary policy is related to current macroeconomic variables. Any
policy rule or macro model, however, tells us that it is forecasts
of macro variables that matter for future policy, not the current
data releases. I recommend that the authors consider macro
projections from the SEP or surveys. Of course, other empirical work
has already related SEP macro projections to SEP policy projections,
so it will be important to explain the value added relative to
existing work. One idea is to relate revisions in the projections of
future policy rates to revisions of macro forecasts. The second
problem of the analysis is that there are only very few observations
with a large overlap in the dependent variable. Reliable statistical 
inference in such a setting is next to impossible. From the
literature on robust (HAC) standard errors it is clear that
Newey-West standard errors are completely unreliable in such a small
sample. Third, the analysis ignores balance sheet policies, which
are an important part of monetary policy during this
episode. Fourth, given the short time period and specific historic
circumstances the results are not externally valid, that is, they
cannot be generalized to the preferences or reactions of monetary
policy makers during any other time. Fifth, and this is surely a
result of some of the previous problems I have listed, the results
are simply implausible, in particular that "the FOMC was responding
mroe strongly to labour market conditions" than to
inflation. Inflation was an important concern of policy-makers at
the time, as public statements and the FOMC meeting minutes make
abundantly clear.

\item The benefit of smoothing through the observed SEP dots is
unclear. While the horizon of the projections changes, due to their
reference period being certain calendar years, there is no
indication that this matters empirically. The authors hypothesize
that it is important to interpolate to ensure a constant horizon but
provide no evidence to this effect. I recommend that any regression
analysis also be carried out using the raw SEP projections, instead
of the interpolated/smoothed projections, to see whether this makes
any material difference.

\item The analysis of the paper is not motivated by a broader question of
relevance for macroeconomics/monetary economics/central banking. In
fact, it is unclear what the research question of the paper is. I
encourage the authors to clearly explain what we learn from the
analysis in the paper and what broader lessons we can draw from it
about monetary policy. In addition, the marginal contribution of the
paper relative to the existing literature should be clarified. At
this point, the authors simply mention a number related papers (in
Section 2) which have also used the SEP data. But the question
remains open how the present paper differentiates itself from those
papers. In addition, it is necessary to discuss the relation to the
existing literature on monetary policy not only in terms of whether
others used the same data (the SEP), but to explain which issues and
questions that been addressed insufficiently by existing papers and
to which this paper is attempting to give new answers.

\item The paper ignores that
different projections for the policy rate can be due to two reasons:
different macro forecasts and different reaction
functions. Therefore the degree of dispersion is not only evidence
of high uncertainty or dispersion about macro forecasts, but simply
also about different preferences/reaction functions. This
distinction is fundamental in any discussion and analysis of
projections for policy rates.
