* Questions
** Evolution of yield curve
- Why have long-term Treasury yields fallen since December 2016,
  despite three rate hikes by the FOMC and news about balance sheet
  normalization? Why has the yield curve flattened?
  - How do we interpret this decline?
  - Does this yield curve behavior constitute a new conundrum, or are
    there plausible explanations that together can account for the
    flatter yield curve?
- Are declines in long-term yields due to exogenous factors (e.g.,
  monetary easing abroad) so that they represent looser financial
  conditions ¡V which would argue for faster removal of monetary
  stimulus ¡V or are they driven by more pessimistic expectations and
  endogenous declines in the term premium ¡V which would argue for a
  slower removal of monetary stimulus?
** Other asset prices
- Why have both stock and bond prices increased in parallel over 2017?
- Why has the dollar depreciated over this period? 
- What do these asset price movements suggest about the underlying
  fundamental drivers?
** Balance sheet normalization
- How has the news about balance sheet normalization affected bond
  markets? What are possible market scenarios for when the FOMC starts
  capping reinvestments and reducing the balance sheet?
** Risks
- What are the *risks* to financial stability?
- How big is the risk of a new taper tantrum, or more generally a
  major repricing of bond markets?
- How significant is the risk of a stock market crash, given that high
  valuations are predicated on low interest rates?

* Key question and points I want to make
Are lower yields stimulative? do they mean more rate hikes are required?

- Long-term fundamentals/perceptions of r* likely account for only a small
  part of the decline in LT yields
- the majority is inflation risk premium, fiscal policy expectations,
  political/geopolitical risks, easy monetary policy -- mostly term
  premium
  - Treasury yields declined substantially around North Korea headlines,
    such as Tuesday 9/6 when they reached new YTD lows
  - since last FOMC meeting: ongoing geopolitical concerns, domestic fiscal
    policy uncertainties
- Mostly term premium, mostly exogenous (not HHs/firms saving more)
  - more supportive financial conditions
- But also to some degree reflects pessimism about inflation and growth
- In addition, dollar, yields, and stock market consistent with
  expectations of more slowly rising funds rate (due to inflation,
  fiscal policy)
* Relevant evidence
- distinguish three episodes -- conundrum is since December
- yield-curve has flattened since December
  - yield curve before December tightening and most recent
  - time series of 3-month yield and ten-year yield since January 2016
- Blue Chip forecast errors
  - yields were expected to rise and surprised on the downside -- as
    always over the last few years
- real vs. nominal yields
  - more recently (since July FOMC) decline driven by real yields
  - before (January - June) decline mostly driven by inflation
    compensation
- balance sheet normalization
  - Glenn: would be a conundrum if term premium had fallen (stable TP not so
    much of a conundrum) -- as during Greenspan conundrum
- valuations are stretched, partly due to low interest rates
  - risks that higher rates would lead to sudden reversal
- correlations between bond and stock market
  - broadly, yields are down and stock market is up
  - Board memo: this suggests exogenous declines in discount rates
- dollar
  - strong euro due to euro-area recovery and monetary policy
* Summary of readings
- Board memo, July 12, 2017, "Long-run value for the equilibrium rate
  of interest"
  - makes the case for downward revision of r*, shows staff forecast
    errors
- Board memo, July 14, 2017, "Background memo on longer-term interest
  rates"
  - investigates evolution since Dec. 2015, argues that explanations
    include (1) MP easing abroad, (2) (perceived) r* has fallen, but
    finds no evidence that inflation expectations have fallen or lower
    TP due to hedging against downturn. Views this as easing financial
    conditions.
- Board memo, July 18, 2017, "Market outreach on current level of
  U.S. Treasury yields"
  - also suggests that lower r* plays a role, but also views downside
    risks to inflation (in the long run) as a key driver
- Hanson-Lucca-Wright
  - conundrum behavior more common nowadays
  - key empirical finding: puzzling excess sensitivity -- high
    correlation between daily changes at short and long maturities --
    remains after 2000, but over *lower frequencies yields have
    decoupled*. That is, correlations of 6-month or annual changes
    between short and long maturities have substantially
    declined. Hence, "conundrum" periods -- movements of short and
    long yields in opposite directions -- are more common.
  - excess sensitivity: GSS explained it through EH, proposing as an
    explanation changes in pi* (i.e., highly persistent shocks to
    interest rates). But (a) it's mostly in real yields and (b)
    it's mostly in the term premium (Hanson and Stein, 2015)
  - explanation: annual changes (increases) in level are followed by
    flattening of yield curve, much more so than in the past.
    - time series model: include lagged h-period changes in level
    - affine DTSM: include (unspanned) lags of yield factors
  - equilibrium model: shocks to short rates positively correlated with
    bond supply, hence short rates and long rates move in the same
    direction (mortgage convexity, reaching-for-yield, ALM,
    extrapolation, flight-to-quality), but only for a short time because
    slow-moving capital eventually adjusts. term premium shocks are
    transitory.
    - can match coefficient pattern
    - explanations of change since 2000: greater high-frequency excess
      sensitivity because because of more reach-for-yield;
      low-frequency decoupling because of more slow-moving capital
    - less persistent short rate (better anchored inflation
      expectations) and more correlation of short rates
      and term premium could explain change in pattern
  - implications: event study captures only high frequency effects,
    which are transitory; at lower frequencies long rates may be much
    less affected
- Bonis-Ihrig-Wei
  - use a term structure model to estimate portfolio balance effects
  - paths of private MBS/Treasury holdings with and (counterfactual)
    without LSAPs
  - plug these (anticipated) shock sequences into Li-Wei model, which
    is estimated pre-crisis
  - currently LSAPs are compressing term premium by 85-100 bps
- Tau Wu 
  - constructs a present-value based QE measure using survey
    expectations to account for both size and holding period of asset
    purchases
  - regresses TP estimates on macro variables and LSAP measure, finds
    large negative effects on TP
  - Finds smaller term premium effects for QE3 (using program dummy)
  - also documents substantial signaling effects. Intertwined: forward
    guidance extends LSAP expectations; LSAP announcements signal
    lower policy path.
  - explains taper tantrum: revised funds rate and LSAP expectations
  - emphasizes the importance of transparent communication.
- Rich Clarida
  - normalization hasn't roiled bond markets because of successful Fed
    communication about low r* and predictable reinvestment policy
  - during taper tantrum, substantial repricing of funds rate
    expectations. Now, consensus on "new normal" and balance sheet
    normalization won't change that. [Near-term funds rate path also
    more decoupled from balance sheet policy.]
  - balance sheet normalizes slowly -- two instead of three desserts
    is still a lot of sugar -- Fed will continue to buy MBS for a
    while and will ultimately still most likely have a large balance
    sheet
  - upside risks: if markets price in more hawkish behavior of foreign
    central banks
