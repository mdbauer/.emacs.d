* Summary

This paper compares the predictive power of the return-forecasting
factor proposed by Cochrane and Piazzesi (CP)---a linear combination of
forward rates---to the predictive power of three principal components
in the yield curve for excess returns over different holding
periods. Its findings suggest that different linear combinations of
forward rates are useful for predicting returns at different holding
periods; that is, if one is working with return-forecasting factors,
it should be constructed based on a specific horizon of excess returns.

* Evaluation

The two key findings of CP are that (a) there is a single factor structure
for annual excess returns of bonds with different maturities and (b)
that the single factor is not completely captured by the first three
principal components (PCs) of the yield curve. They focused on annual
excess bond returns, and were explicit about the fact that a monthly
VAR (i.e., a model designed to capture one-month-ahead predictability)
does not capture the patterns found for annual returns. CP made no
claims about their factor predicting bonds at other maturities. 

The present paper's key finding---that there is no single factor
structure for returns /at different holding periods/---is therefore
unsurprising. The result is already suggested by CP's results. The
paper considers a number of different holding periods, but this
doesn't add any new insights. There is also a fair amount of evidence
that yields are not first-order Markov (e.g., Joslin, Le, Singleton, 2013, Journal
of Financial Econometrics; Fenou and Fontaine, 2017, Management
Science), which explains why different information is needed to
predict returns at different horizons. As it is, the paper does not
add any new insights to what we already know about risk in bond
markets.

The analysis in the paper also contains some significant flaws. First,
the results in Figures 1 and 2 on $R^2$ are essentially mechanical, and
there is almost no new evidence in these plots. Of course the linear
combination of yields that best explains $n$ year horizon returns will
do better than PCs of yields at this horizon, and worse at other
horizons (with the small caveat that we are comparing a linear
combination of five yields to three PCs). Second, the fact that $R^2$
rise with horizon is due to the spurious in-sample overfitting of
overlapping returns
well-documented in the literature on return-forecasting. Third, in
Section 2.3, the analysis ignores that the errors have a
moving-average structure and are serially correlated, as well as
mutually correlated. Fourth, in Section 3 the authors present results
for cross-sectional fit, although the focus of CP and of this paper so
far was on prediction of future yields. The authors appear to be
confusing "prediction" (fitting) of yields across maturities with actual
prediction of future yields.

In sum, the paper has serious problems and does not, in its current
shape, make a noteworthy contribution to the yield curve
literature. The authors need to be much more careful in their
analysis. They also need to explain carefully what the relative
contribution is, why the results are surprising or instructive, and
what the broader implications are for bond risk premia and yield curve
analysis. In doing so, they should keep in mind the two key findings
of CP about their return-forecasting factor, and be more careful about
what CP did and what they didn't claim. One suggestion for the authors
would be to investigate whether CP's two key results hold at different
holding periods.
