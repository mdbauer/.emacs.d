* Summary

This paper analyzes the data from FOMC's Summary of Economic
Projections (SEP), focusing on the median and dispersion of the projection for the future
policy rate. First, the evolution of this data is described. Second, a
non-linear model is used to fit the median dots on each date. Third,
the projections are regressed on macro variables. The regression
results include  stronger and more significant response coefficients to unemployment than
inflation. 

* Evaluation

The SEP releases provide a valuable new source of information not only
to market participants but also for researchers that are trying to
better understand the preferences and reactions of policy-makers to
the changing macroeconomic environment. At the zero lower bound, this
can be particularly useful since the federal funds rate is stuck near
zero and projections of its future evolution become even more relevant
than during normal times. The current paper uses this new data, but
does not provide any new insights about central bank behavior or this
particular historic episodes. Part of the analysis is just
descriptive, while the regression analysis suffers from substantial
problems that likely invalidate the results. In the following I
describe the problems in more detail and suggest some possible
remedies.

- The only substantial empirical analysis of the paper are the
  regression results in Section 5, since the rest of the results is
  purely descriptive and does not add any significant value or
  insights relative to the observed behavior of the SEP. The first
  problem with these regressions is that projections of future
  monetary policy is related to current macroeconomic variables. Any
  policy rule or macro model, however, tells us that it is forecasts
  of macro variables that matter for future policy, not the current
  data releases. I recommend that the authors consider macro
  projections from the SEP or surveys. Of course, other empirical work
  has already related SEP macro projections to SEP policy projections,
  so it will be important to explain the value added relative to
  existing work. One idea is to relate revisions in the projections of
  future policy rates to revisions of macro forecasts. The second
  problem of the analysis is that there are only very few observations
  with a large overlap in the dependent variable. Reliable statistical 
  inference in such a setting is next to impossible. From the
  literature on robust (HAC) standard errors it is clear that
  Newey-West standard errors are completely unreliable in such a small
  sample. Third, the analysis ignores balance sheet policies, which
  are an important part of monetary policy during this
  episode. Fourth, given the short time period and specific historic
  circumstances the results are not externally valid, that is, they
  cannot be generalized to the preferences or reactions of monetary
  policy makers during any other time. Fifth, and this is surely a
  result of some of the previous problems I have listed, the results
  are simply implausible, in particular that "the FOMC was responding
  more strongly to labour market conditions" than to
  inflation. Inflation was an important concern of policy-makers at
  the time, as public statements and the FOMC meeting minutes make
  abundantly clear. 

- The benefit of smoothing through the observed SEP dots is
  unclear. While the horizon of the projections changes, due to their
  reference period being certain calendar years, there is no
  indication that this matters empirically. The authors hypothesize
  that it is important to interpolate to ensure a constant horizon but
  provide no evidence to this effect. I recommend that any regression
  analysis also be carried out using the raw SEP projections, instead
  of the interpolated/smoothed projections, to see whether this makes
  any material difference.

- The analysis of the paper is not motivated by a broader question of
  relevance for macroeconomics/monetary economics/central banking. In
  fact, it is unclear what the research question of the paper is. I
  encourage the authors to clearly explain what we learn from the
  analysis in the paper and what broader lessons we can draw from it
  about monetary policy. In addition, the marginal contribution of the
  paper relative to the existing literature should be clarified. At
  this point, the authors simply mention a number related papers (in
  Section 2) which have also used the SEP data. But the question
  remains open how the present paper differentiates itself from those
  papers. In addition, it is necessary to discuss the relation to the
  existing literature on monetary policy not only in terms of whether
  others used the same data (the SEP), but to explain which issues and
  questions that been addressed insufficiently by existing papers and
  to which this paper is attempting to give new answers.

- The paper ignores that
  different projections for the policy rate can be due to two reasons:
  different macro forecasts and different reaction
  functions. Therefore the degree of dispersion is not only evidence
  of high uncertainty or dispersion about macro forecasts, but simply
  also about different preferences/reaction functions. This
  distinction is fundamental in any discussion and analysis of
  projections for policy rates.
