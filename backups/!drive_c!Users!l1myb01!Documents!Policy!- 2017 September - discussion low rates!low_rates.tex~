\section{Questions}
\label{sec:org4d92f54}
\subsection{Evolution of yield curve}
\label{sec:orgdadc375}
Why have long-term Treasury yields fallen since December 2016, despite
  three rate hikes by the FOMC and news about balance sheet
  normalization? Why has the yield curve flattened? How do we
  interpret this decline? Does this yield curve behavior constitute a
  new conundrum, or are there plausible explanations that together can
  account for the flatter yield curve?

\begin{enumerate}
\item Real/rate expectations and r*
\begin{itemize}
\item somewhat lower expectations for path of real short rate, but per
se this cannot explain large declines in forward rates.
\item model-based estimates have remained low and not fallen
further. But perceived r* likely has shifted down a bit. Market
participants may have come on board more for low estimates. Over
the last year, surveys and SEP of r* are down about 0.25-0.5.
\item Real forward rate has fallen recently but that could be due to
real term premium
\end{itemize}
\item Inflation expectations and inflation risk: 
\begin{itemize}
\item near-term expectations shifted down but 10-year expectations unchanged.
\item TIPS breakevens accounted for a notable share of yield decline
Jan-Jun, suggesting that inflation risk premium declined. BEIs
stable since then, more recently (since July FOMC) declines driven
by real yields
\item economic argument: bond investors worried about deflation, bonds
are a hedge, willing to pay premium (more neg. IRP)
\end{itemize}
\item Term premium
\begin{itemize}
\item estimates suggest that it \textbf{accounts for most of the
decline in yields}
\item in addition to inflation risk premium, real term
premium declined because of (geo)political risks, fiscal policy
expectations, \textbf{easy monetary policy abroad} (see Board evidence)
\item Treasury yields declined substantially around North Korea headlines,
such as Tuesday 9/6 when they reached new YTD lows
\item since last FOMC meeting: ongoing geopolitical concerns, domestic fiscal
policy uncertainties
\item \textbf{excess sensitivity}: term premium correlated with near-term short
rate expectations. This may reverse over time.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Other asset prices}
\label{sec:org3e9b4b7}
Why have both stock and bond prices increased in parallel over 2017?
Why has the dollar depreciated over this period? What do these asset
price movements suggest about the underlying fundamental drivers?

\begin{itemize}
\item Board: The fact that both bond and stock markets have been on a tear (both
in the U.S. and globally) suggests reductions in the discount rate
or negative surprises to inflation (risk); not so much news about
the growth outlook.
\item dollar strong euro due to euro-area recovery and monetary policy
\item dollar, yields, and stock market consistent with
expectations of easier monetary policy (e.g., due to inflation,
fiscal policy) and exogenous shocks to term premium
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Balance sheet normalization}
\label{sec:orgdfb7528}
How has the news about balance sheet normalization affected bond
  markets? What are possible market scenarios for when the FOMC starts
  capping reinvestments and reducing the balance sheet?

\begin{itemize}
\item Glenn: would be a conundrum if term premium had fallen (stable TP not so
much of a conundrum) -- as during Greenspan conundrum. Term premium
has in fact fallen.
\item substantial shift in expected timing of normalization, but absence
of movements in term premium. Possible explanations:
\begin{itemize}
\item TPE simply too small to notice, masked by other developments
\item counteracted by expectations of larger final balance sheet
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Risks}
\label{sec:org1598ffe}
What are the \textbf{risks} to financial stability? How big is the risk of a new taper tantrum, or more generally a
  major repricing of bond markets? How significant is the risk of a stock market crash, given that high
  valuations are predicated on low interest rates?

\begin{itemize}
\item (equity/real estate/credit) valuations are stretched, partly due to
low interest rates and low volatility. risks that higher rates would
lead to sudden reversals/rise in volatility
\item TPE of balance sheet normalization may start to materialize (once
slow-moving capital shifts; once effects are felt; expectations are
surprised; flow effects)
\item some risks from monetary policy abroad
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Policy implications}
\label{sec:org63678bf}
Are declines in long-term yields due to exogenous factors (e.g.,
  monetary easing abroad) so that they represent looser financial
  conditions -- which would argue for faster removal of monetary
  stimulus -- or are they driven by more pessimistic expectations and
  endogenous declines in the term premium -- which would argue for a
  slower removal of monetary stimulus? 

In short: Are lower yields stimulative? do they mean more rate hikes are
    required?

\begin{itemize}
\item Arguments for faster removal of accommodation
\begin{itemize}
\item Mostly term premium, mostly exogenous (not HHs/firms saving more),
hence low yields are stimulative.
\item Important role of monetary easing abroad. Board emphasizes this.
\end{itemize}
\item Arguments for slower removal
\begin{itemize}
\item lower yields also reflect pessimism about inflation and the
equilibrium real rate (and possibly to a small degree about growth)
\item Future increases in term premiums are likely (mean reversion,
slow-moving capital, foreign monetary policy normalizes,
increasing effects of balance sheet normalization)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Summary of readings}
\label{sec:org967e457}
\begin{itemize}
\item Board memo, July 12, 2017, "Long-run value for the equilibrium rate
of interest"
\begin{itemize}
\item makes the case for downward revision of r*, shows staff forecast
errors
\end{itemize}
\item Board memo, July 14, 2017, "Background memo on longer-term interest
rates"
\begin{itemize}
\item investigates evolution since Dec. 2015, argues that explanations
include (1) MP easing abroad, (2) (perceived) r* has fallen, but
finds no evidence that inflation expectations have fallen or lower
TP due to hedging against downturn. Views this as easing financial
conditions.
\end{itemize}
\item Board memo, July 18, 2017, "Market outreach on current level of
U.S. Treasury yields"
\begin{itemize}
\item also suggests that lower r* plays a role, but also views downside
risks to inflation (in the long run) as a key driver
\end{itemize}
\item Hanson-Lucca-Wright
\begin{itemize}
\item conundrum behavior more common nowadays
\item key empirical finding: puzzling excess sensitivity -- high
correlation between daily changes at short and long maturities --
remains after 2000, but over \textbf{lower frequencies yields have
decoupled}. That is, correlations of 6-month or annual changes
between short and long maturities have substantially
declined. Hence, "conundrum" periods -- movements of short and
long yields in opposite directions -- are more common.
\item excess sensitivity: GSS explained it through EH, proposing as an
explanation changes in pi* (i.e., highly persistent shocks to
interest rates). But (a) it's mostly in real yields and (b)
it's mostly in the term premium (Hanson and Stein, 2015)
\item explanation: annual changes (increases) in level are followed by
flattening of yield curve, much more so than in the past.
\begin{itemize}
\item time series model: include lagged h-period changes in level
\item affine DTSM: include (unspanned) lags of yield factors
\end{itemize}
\item equilibrium model: shocks to short rates positively correlated with
bond supply, hence short rates and long rates move in the same
direction (mortgage convexity, reaching-for-yield, ALM,
extrapolation, flight-to-quality), but only for a short time because
slow-moving capital eventually adjusts. term premium shocks are
transitory.
\begin{itemize}
\item can match coefficient pattern
\item explanations of change since 2000: greater high-frequency excess
sensitivity because because of more reach-for-yield;
low-frequency decoupling because of more slow-moving capital
\item less persistent short rate (better anchored inflation
expectations) and more correlation of short rates
and term premium could explain change in pattern
\end{itemize}
\item implications: event study captures only high frequency effects,
which are transitory; at lower frequencies long rates may be much
less affected
\end{itemize}
\item Bonis-Ihrig-Wei
\begin{itemize}
\item use a term structure model to estimate portfolio balance effects
\item paths of private MBS/Treasury holdings with and (counterfactual)
without LSAPs
\item plug these (anticipated) shock sequences into Li-Wei model, which
is estimated pre-crisis
\item currently LSAPs are compressing term premium by 85-100 bps
\end{itemize}
\item Tau Wu 
\begin{itemize}
\item constructs a present-value based QE measure using survey
expectations to account for both size and holding period of asset
purchases
\item regresses TP estimates on macro variables and LSAP measure, finds
large negative effects on TP
\item Finds smaller term premium effects for QE3 (using program dummy)
\item also documents substantial signaling effects. Intertwined: forward
guidance extends LSAP expectations; LSAP announcements signal
lower policy path.
\item explains taper tantrum: revised funds rate and LSAP expectations
\item emphasizes the importance of transparent communication.
\end{itemize}
\item Rich Clarida
\begin{itemize}
\item normalization hasn't roiled bond markets because of successful Fed
communication about low r* and predictable reinvestment policy
\item during taper tantrum, substantial repricing of funds rate
expectations. Now, consensus on "new normal" and balance sheet
normalization won't change that. [Near-term funds rate path also
more decoupled from balance sheet policy.]
\item balance sheet normalizes slowly -- two instead of three desserts
is still a lot of sugar -- Fed will continue to buy MBS for a
while and will ultimately still most likely have a large balance
sheet
\item upside risks: if markets price in more hawkish behavior of foreign
central banks
\end{itemize}
\item SOMA projections
\begin{itemize}
\item only marginal change relative to last year's report
\item expectations pulled forward but start very gradual, overall
similar trajectory / NPV
\end{itemize}
\item Glenn's conundrum paper
\begin{itemize}
\item two macro-finance models cannot explain/fit the decline in
long-term yields/in the term premium
\item that is, normal yield-curve and macro factors not enough; large
negative residual
\item change in foreign demand cannot explain the conundrum
\item lower volatility correlated with lower yields, partial explanation
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
