TODO: get some more pithy statements and example from *Naked Money*

* Inflation
- First let・s back up a little and start by asking, why is inflation
  important? How is it measured? And why is high inflation a bad thing
  for the economy?
  - At a basic level, inflation is simply the rate at which prices
    increase in the U.S., on average
  - There are actually people employed by a government agency that go
    to stores and just look at prices and write them down. And that's
    hundreds of people and thousands of prices, recorded all the time
    in all parts of our economy.
  - Since inflation measures how fast prices rise, the flip side of
    this definition is that it also measures the rate at which our money
    loses value.
  - So you see that is pretty important to know. On a general level,
    money and prices are central to our economic system, and
    this makes inflation so important. And more specifically, it
    matters for all kinds of decisions: how much of a wage increase
    people should try to negotiate, how much to save for retirement,
    just to name a couple.
  - High inflation is bad on so many different levels. If prices rise
    quickly, I cannot keep much cash in my bank account since it loses
    value so quickly. And if wages don't keep up with inflation, we
    won't be able to afford as much as we used to. It's also bad for
    people who have invested or lent out their money, for example
    their retirement savings will be worth less.
  - Now if we all knew for sure that inflation was going to be, say,
    10% exactly for the rest of our lives, then we could plan
    accordingly, demand higher wages and interest rates, and so
    forth. But unfortunatley high inflation always goes hand in hand
    with a lot of ups and downs, and a lot of uncertainty.
  - So what we really want is low and stable inflation.

- In recent years, inflation has been relatively low, but I remember
  back in the late 70s early 80s when inflation was double digit. What
  was going on then?
  - This period is crucial to understand both inflation and the role
    of the central bank. It even has its own name, the "Great
    Inflation", capitalized.
  - This period shows what happens if the central bank screws
    up. Economists nowadays agree that inflation got out of control
    because of a failure of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve.
  - Let's take a step back and think about monetary policy 101: As we
    are all well aware, the Fed can slow down the economy by raising
    interest rates, and support the economy by lowering interest
    rates. Another way to say this is the Fed can let the supply of
    money increase quickly or slow down the growth of the money
    supply. In the former case, prices tend to rise more quickly, and
    in the latter case, they tend to rise more slowly. So in the long
    run, aside from the ups and downs, aside from temporary cycles and
    shocks, in the long run it's the central bank that controls
    inflation. That's what prompted Milton Friedman's famous
    statement: Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary
    phenomenon.
  - So what happened in the 1970s is that the Fed allowed the money
    supply to growth too quickly, it didn't raise interest rates
    enough in response to the circumstances at the time, in particular
    the oil shocks of the 70s. It lost control of inflation, and in 1980 we ended
    up with 15% of inflation. To reverse this situation was a long and
    painful process, involving two recessions in the early 1980s, but
    thanks to a new Fed Chairman at the time, Paul Volcker, the Fed
    finally got the situation under control and we've had low and
    stable inflation ever since.

* Pi-star, 2% Inflation Target
- Now let・s talk about the inflation target. What is an inflation
  target, and why do you guys call it ：pi-star；?
  - So we know the central bank ultimately can determine the inflation
    rate. And the goal is to have low and stable inflation.
  - One particularly effective method to accomplish this goal is for
    the central bank to publicly announce that it is committed to a
    certain low rate of inflation, such as two percent.
  - Making such a public commitment to a goal of a certain inflation
    rate, that is called an inflation target
  - It's important to understand that it is a goal for the *long
    run*. We may have a recession, and inflation may drop below the
    target. Or we may have an oil price boom that pushes energy
    inflation and with it overall inflation above the target
    rate. That is okay. It's not possible to be at the inflation
    target all the time. We just want to be close to the inflation target on
    average, over the long run.
  - (symmetric vs. ceiling)
  - Now why "pi*"? It's for two reasons:
    - First, economists typically denote the rate of inflation by the
      Greek letter "pi".
    - Second, the long-run values of economic variables, the
      equilibrium that the economy goes back to once all the
      transitory shocks and ups and downs have dissipated, such
      long-run values are denoted with asterisks. Hence: pi*
- Tell us a little about the history pi*. Has the Federal Reserve
  always had an inflation target?
  - For the longest time, the Fed did not appear to have a specific
    inflation target in mind when setting monetary policy.
  - Certainly the Fed didn't publicly announce a target until recently.
  - However, since about the 1990s, inflation has always remained low and
    stable, and at some point people realized that the Fed appeared to
    be targeting a certain inflation rate. So you could maybe say
    they had an implicit inflatino target, but it wasn't public.
- When did the Fed announce an explicit inflation target, and what
  exactly did we announce?
  - In January 2012, the Fed finally came out publicly with an
    inflation target.
  - As part of a statement on longer-run goals, the FOMC said that a
    rate of 2 percent was most consistent with its mandate.
  - They were pretty explicit and clarified
    what price index they would focus on, namely the price index for
    personal consumption expenditures, or PCE.
  - So in short, they said that their long-run goal for PCE inflation
    was going to be 2%
- Is there something magical about 2%? Why don・t we want zero percent
  inflation?
  - Exactly, why 2%? That is the million-dollar question about the
    inflation target.
  - It's probably a bad idea to aim for zero percent inflation, for a
    couple of reasons.
  - The first is that the statistical agencies tend to overestimate
    the true rate of inflation. That means, if we wanted truly stable
    prices, we would want about .5-1% of measured inflation.
  - But a more important argument is the so-called "greasing the
    wheels" argument, which was made forcefully by Janet Yellen at
    FOMC meetings in the 1990s, when she was a governor
  - The argument goes that you need a little bit of inflation to keep
    the economy running smoothly.
  - When businesses run into rough
    times, they would like to cut wages to keep costs down. That's
    hard to do, so they instead cut hours or fire workers. But
    inflation helps to deal with this problem: if businesses simply
    don't raise wages, then in inflation-adjusted terms their wage
    costs have fallen. That way they might be able to avoid layoffs,
    and we would see more people keep their jobs during a recession.
  - And you have a somewhat similar situation for monetary policy. The
    Fed cannot lower interest rates below zero (just like businesses
    cannot easily cut wages). But with positive inflation and zero
    interest rates, inflation-adjusted interest rates are negative, so
    businesses and consumers have an incentive to invest it and spend
    their money.
  - So in short, some inflation is useful to "grease the wheels" of
    the economy, and for it to better whether downturns.
- We・ve been talking about the U.S. and the Fed, but what about other
  countries and other central banks? Is the 2% inflation target pretty
  consistent across countries?
  - Yes, a number of central bank have a 2% inflation target
  - The first were the kiwis. The New Zealand central bank announced
    a 2% target in the late 1980s
  - Many central banks have followed suit.
  - A prominent example is the ECB, which aims for inflation below but
    close to 2%.
  - Note here that there is a subtle but important difference with our
    inflation target. Our target is *symmetric*, so the Fed would try to avoid
    being either below or above 2%. On the other hand the ECB views 2%
    as a ceiling, so they are more comfortable with inflation being
    below 2% than it being above 2%.
- We hear a lot about the importance of ．expectations・. Why is it so
  important that people view the central bank・s inflation target to be
  credible, and expect future inflation to average about 2%? That is,
  why are expectations important, and why is credibility important?
  - Economics is one of the few areas in life where just expecting
    something can actually make it come true.
  - Kidding aside, it's very clear that expectations about the future
    play a fundamental role in our decision-making.
  - If I expect inflation of 10% then I'm going to try to negotiate a
    higher wage increase than if I expected 0% inflation.
  - Inflation expectations also matter for businesses setting prices,
    for savers that invest their money, and for the central bank
    trying to stimulate or slow down the economy.
  - As a result of all of this, actual future inflation is to a large
    extent determined by expectations of future inflation.
  - So if people confidently expect 2% inflation, then this goes a
    long way towards inflation actually being close to 2%.
  - That is the main reason why it is so effective for a central bank
    to publicly announce an inflation target.
  - Of course, this only works if people actually believe this
    announcement, that is, if the inflation target is credible. Only
    in that case will businesses and workers make their decisions
    based on the expectation of a future rate of inflation that is
    driven by the announced inflation target.
- There has been discussion about possibly raising the inflation
  target, for example to 3 or 4%. Do you think that is a good idea?
  What are the arguments for and against such a move?
  - This is indeed one of the most heated discussions curently going
    on among economists and central bankers.
  - Chair Yellen at her recent press conference said that whether to
    raise inflation targets is one of the most critical questions
    that central bankers face these days.
  - The argument for raising the target, which John Williams has
    described very clearly in recent speeches and Economic Letters,
    goes as follows: pi* is one determinant, together with r* (about
    which I understand we have another segment in this series), that
    determines the overall level of interest rates. higher pi*
    therefore means a higher "normal" level of interest rates. If a
    recession hits, the central bank cuts interest rates, but it can
    only cut to zero. So if you start out with a higher level of
    interest rates, then there is more room to cut rates, that is,
    more room to support the economy which faces a downturn
  - Recently a group of 22 economists, including prominent figures
    such as the former Minneapolis Fed president and the chief
    economist of Barack Obama, wrote a public letter to Chair Yellen
    asking her to consider raising its 2 percent inflation target
  - But it's a really difficult question, and there are arguments both
    for and against raising the target.
  - An obvious reason against raising the target is that it increases
    the uncertainty about whether the Fed is then really committed to
    the new target, or whether they might change it again in the
    future. And uncertainty of course is a bad thing, as it undermined
    the credibility of the target
  - So more research and discussion is needed on this question, but
    it's a debate that is actively taking place

* Wrap-Up
- If you had to sum up our conversation about Pi-star to someone in a
  short line for a Pete・s coffee, what would you say?
  - It's good for all of us if inflation is low and stable, and the
    best way for the Fed to make sure it stays that way is to have an
    explicit inflation target that is clear, credible, and well-understood.
