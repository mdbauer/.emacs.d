* Summary

This paper combines an equilibrium model for the yield curve,
featuring long-run risks, with the shadow-rate approach to ensure
non-negative nominal interest rates. The equilibrium model for yields corresponds to the long-run risk term structure model of
Bansal and Shaliastovich (2013). Yields are affine
functions of three risk factors: expected inflation, expected
consumption growth, and inflation volatility (since consumption
volatility is assumed to be constant). These yields are taken to the
data in the "No ZLB model" and parameters are estimated over the
pre-ZLB period using Bayesian methods. For the "ZLB model" the
equilibrium model is combined with Fisher Black's shadow-rate
specification, so that
the nominal short rate at each date is the maximum of the shadow rate
from the equilibrium model and zero. The authors find that these two
models show some substantial differences over the ZLB period in terms
of the filtered macro factors, in particular expected inflation, and a
few other metrics.

* Overall evaluation and substantial problems

The paper addresses a relevant open issue in macro-finance, namely how
to reconcile equilibrium models of the yield curve with a ZLB
situation. Combining the shadow-rate approach with an equilibrium
model seems at first sight like a natural way to do so. However, there
are also some problems with this approach, which the paper completely
ignores. Furthermore, it is unclear what questions the paper is trying
to answer, and this lack of focus is reflected in the results. It is
unclear what we learn from them. I will first describe the substantial
problems that the authors need to address for publication; in the next
section I make additional suggestions that would improve the paper. 

** Why an equilibrium model for the shadow rate?

The methodological innovation of the paper is to combine the long-run
risk model with a shadow-rate specification. But there is an inconsistency between the shadow-rate specification and
the derivation of the SDF and yields in the equilibrium model: the
equilibrium model ignores the ZLB, and counterfactually assumes that
households face the shadow rate. The theoretically consistent approach
would be to incorporate the ZLB at the outset, not after the model is
solved. Tacking on the shadow-rate specification---an approach that is
used exclusively in reduced-form yield curve models---is completely ad
hoc. While this is theoretically undesirable, this may or may not be a serious problem for the empirical
results. But the presence of this inconsistency needs to be discussed,
and the authors need to argue and ideally show that this problem does
not distort the results. The paper lacks a motivation and
justification of the modeling approach; the pros and cons need to be
discussed. 

Notably there are some papers with equilibrium models for
the yield curve that incorporate the ZLB in a theoretically consistent
fashion, in particular in the DSGE context (e.g., Nakata and Tanaka,
2016, "Equilibrium Yield Curves and the Interest Rate Lower
Bound"). This line of work should be acknowledged and the contribution
of the paper put in perspective. It is clearly possible to directly
incorporate the ZLB into the equilibrium model. (Another way to put
this criticism is: Why would we linearize first and then use shadow
rates, instead of consistently addressing the non-linear ZLB
constraint from the get-go, like other papers have done?)

In addition to addressing this concern about the modeling strategy,
the authors also need to better explain the marginal contribution
relative to the literature. The long-run risk model is from
Bansal-Shaliastovich, the ZLB yield solution method is from Krippner
and Wi-Xia, the sub-sample estimation idea is from Bauer-Rudebusch,
and the estimation method is from Schorfheide et al. What is the
benefit of combining these in one paper, and what is truly novel?
Maybe the novelty is to have stochastic volatility factors in a
shadow-rate model. But this raises the question why
we need an equilibrium model, since one could alternatively specify the
no-arbitrage reduced-form model without the restrictions imposed by
the structural model.

** What do we learn about yields at the zero lower bound?

Part of the reason why it's difficult to see the value of the
methodological contribution is that the paper doesn't describe the
economic/empirical questions that it sets out to answer. The reader is
left confused what to make of the various empirical results and how to
interpret them from a macro-finance perspective. In addition, one
wonders which of the results are due to the presence of an equilibrium
model and whether one couldn't have obtained mostly the same results in a
reduced-form model that features the same risk factors. Overall, the
paper unfortunately reads as if the central question was "What happens
if we combine Bansal-Shaliastovich with shadow rates?" which makes it
difficult to interpret the results. 

More specifically, most readers will be confused what we learn from
the comparison of (a) ZLB yields, (b) affine (no ZLB) yields, and (c)
shadow yields. Previous work has shown how and why these differ in
reduced-form models during the ZLB period. It seems obvious that they
would also be different in this model. What new lessons do we learn
from this experiment? What is the counterfactual in each case?

* Suggestions

- I think it would be really interesting to see what the equilibrium
  model adds relative to a reduced-form model with the same risk
  factors, by estimating both. That would address various of my concerns above.
- Of course the high road to take would be, probably for a different
  paper, to incorporate the ZLB constraint directly into the long-run
  risk model. Some short-cuts may be necessary for tractability but we
  might really learn more about the effects of the ZLB on economic
  agents in such a setting. 
- The paper should report the fit of the model to observed yields in
  terms of root-mean-squared errors. My impression from the figures is
  that the model has a pretty difficult time fitting yields.
- It's an overstatement to say that "expected real growth and
  inflation track well the low frequency movements in realized
  macroeconomic variables" (p. 15). There are prolonged periods where
  these expectations are nowhere near the realizations. This surely is
  due to the substantial tension between fitting yields and fitting
  macro variables. I recommend the authors acknowledge the tension and
  explain whether it is a concern.
- The authors use Bayesian estimation but nowhere report credibility
  bounds for the objects of interest (other than the parameter
  estimates in the affine model). Using such bounds they could answer
  the question whether differences during the ZLB period are actually
  significant. A related issue is that it's unclear whether/why for the
  ZLB model the parameters are fixed at their posterior means (p. 17
  is not exactly clear here); it seems desirable to use the draws from
  the posterior distribution instead of fixed parameters.
- Is it really not possible to estimate the ZLB model? It seems that
  Bayesian methods are exactly what would allow us to do this, due to
  the ability to iterate on MCMC blocks that are easily sampled,
  to condition on state variables, and to tune the algorithm. The
  contribution of the paper would be much stronger if the model that
  the authors are interested in was the one that is estimated.
- The paper briefly mentions "the importance of a zero lower bound for
  a correct measurement and identification of the risk premia in
  financial markets" (p. 21). It seems like this should be the focus
  of the paper, since this is where the long-run risk models
  potentially has the most to add.

* Smaller points

- Krippner's approach for ZLB yields is equivalent to Wu-Xia's
  approach, as described clearly by Priebsch.
- The consumption volatility factor is kept constant but all the
  notation has it time-varying. That is unnecessary and confusing.
