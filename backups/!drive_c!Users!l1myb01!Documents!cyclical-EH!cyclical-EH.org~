** Henkel et al  -- key paper!
** Bansal, Tauchen, Zhou (2004)
- regime-shifting term structure model
  - two regimes

- explains predictability results of Cochrane-Piazzesi
- in particular it can generate a tent-shaped coefficient pattern
- interesting patterns between business cycle and regimes (and slope
  of the yield curve)
- but no indication that EH is approximately valid

-> would have to link our results to this paper
** Ang and Bekaert (2002) Regime Switches in Interest Rates
- regime-switching models for interest rates forecast better
- regimes are related to the business cycle

"Mankiw and Miron (1986) ... argued that the interest rate smoothing efforts of the Federal
Reserve Bank make the U.S. short rate behave like a random
walk, and this behavior causes rejections of the expectations
hypothesis"

** Hamilton (1988)
- regime-switching model for the short rate
  - regime switches in the intercept and in the innovation variance
- using RE and EH, this implies yields that are pretty close to
  actually observed yields

** Hamilton and Okimoto (2010)
*** Abstract
This study relates predictable gains from positions in fed funds
futures contracts to violations of the expectations hypothesis of the
term structure of interest rates.  Although evidence for predictable
gains from positions in short-horizon contracts is mixed, we find that
gains in longer horizon contracts can be well described using
Markov-switching models, with predictability associated with
particular episodes in which economic activity was weak and
variability in the returns to these contracts was quite high.
*** my summary
** Rossi (2012) Advances in Forecasting under Instability
- mainly concerned with one break in forecasting ability, or
  differences between in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting power
* Ideas
- could a regime-switching term structure model in which one regime is
  the EH still fit the data and match
  Campbell-Shiller/Cochrane-Piazzesi evidence?

[2015-10-27 Tue]
- does shifting endpoint maybe explain violation from EH?
- can we look at variability of TP in different stages of the cycle?
  - my intuition: not if it's based on full-sample estimates
- TVP model
  - could even have predetermined variables driving beta_t
- regime-switching model
- dummy variable

- long-run violations of EH
  - fall in r*/pi* explains systematic misses of excess return regressions
  - similar pattern for inflation as for interest rate forecasts
  - could one incorporate r*/pi* in excess return regressions?

* phone call Aeimit 1/11/2016
- Thomas?
  - totally fine with him
  - what is the economics behind predictability?

** simple rolling regressions
** Markov-switching
- new results: don't reject at the 1% level that regime 1 is EH
  - economic signifiance: difference in population R^2 in each regime

- one state variable?
  - if you have two state variables -- one for variance and one for
    means -- then regime switches are mostly driven by the variance regimes
  - what feature of the data drives the changes in regime?
  - is there a theory that tells us anything about the shock
    variances? presumably no
- next: let's separately test parameter stability like in Table III of
  Jim's paper

- how to see whether observables are related to regime probabilities
  - transition probabilities that depend on observable variables:
    Hamilton (2015) section 2.9; Filardo, Andrew J., and Stephen F. Gordon (1998), ¡°Business Cycle
    Durations,¡± Journal of Econometrics 85, 99-123.
  - this is the appropriate way to address this
  - look at papers to see whether this gives us a way to test the
    relevant null hypothesis: does some variable x_t affect the
    probability?

me: look at predictability literature and related papers
(regime-switching predictability, Jim's paper, Rossi's paper, others)

what we could do:
- do it for different maturities
  - do it separately, or better, jointly
- include autoregressive component
  - keep on backburner: RSAR for excess returns
- RSVAR
  - do this down the road
- note that in Henkel's paper, in the US, term spread has effect on
  stock returns that's no different btw. expansions and recessions

what to go over:
- SEs
- tests? R^2?
- rolling regressions

** TODO look at papers mentioned in Henkel et al
Our RSVAR most closely resembles that of Guidolin and
Timmermann (2007), but we use bond yields rather than
bond returns. This subtle difference can lead to large
differences in results since bond yields are persistent, but
bond returns are not. This difference can be seen in the weak
role that bond returns play in Chen, Roll, and Ross (1986) and
Fama and French (1993) compared to the much stronger role
bond yields play in Keim and Stambaugh (1986) and
Campbell (1996). As such, Guidolin and Timmermann
(2007) is primarily about asset allocation with state-varying
return comovement between stocks and bonds.

- R^2
  - what he did is similar to my second suggestion - using subsamples

- TVP
  - first look more carefully into rolling regressions

- let's look at 2x2 regimes?!
  - Aeimit has done it and we can easily look at it

- Mike: rolling regressions with confidence intervals
  - see in which periods EH cannot be rejected
  - could also do it with system of equations

* call Aeimit 3/8/2016
agenda/ideas:
- is git/gitlab working for him?
- I need to look over Swanson-Williams code
- we need significant results that EH works well
  - compare trading strategies/forecasts based on EH

[my idea: just use rolling regressions on slope]

- can we identify observables that correlate with periods with EH
  -> trading rule/forecasting rule that says: based on some observable
  cycle, if they satisfy a condition, forecast using EH

Aeimit will pull the repository and then we'll look at the results
together

* call Aeimit 3/18/2016
- TVP model
  - let's look at smoothed gamma
  - how does this line up with recession or tightening episodes?
  - create dummy that's one when this is significantly positive
  - how do we deal with uncertainty around beta?
  - let's focus on scalar predictor - just the slope, 10y-1y
  - we could do Bayesian estimation to incorporate stochastic volatility?

Mike:
- read papers
- work with Simon

* call Aeimit 4/14/2016
points to discuss:
- his results
- RA transition
- strategy going forward

next steps:
- email Allan Timmerman
  - include result on cyclicality
  - first send Aeimit the draft

- simple regressions with slope
  - with interactions
    - NBER recession indicators
    - tightening/losening cycle - monetary policy indicator
  - revisit rolling regressions - different window lengths, think
    about ECONOMICS of the cyclicality

- don't do anything more complicated until we find something in the
  data

- Aeimit: maybe take a MTSM, specify feedback from monetary policy to
  the yield curve
  - Stein + Sunderam -- gradualism in monetary policy, how should the
    fed repond to term premium shocks -- nobody has tested this in the
    data
  - macro-finance models have inflation target shocks -
    e.g. Bekaert-Cho-Moreno and many others
  - we could specify a reduced-form VAR for macro data and yields, and
    then have regime-switching where one regime is the EH
    - maybe then identify monetary policy shocks
=> look at Gertler-Karadi

Aeimit's semester is done by end of this month

[2016-07-28 Thu]
- good results, Campbell-Shiller in tightening episodes
  - except for the fact that coefficient is still negative
- one question is *why* is this happening
- could look at whether there is more *policy inertia* during
  tightening
  - for example interaction tightening dummy with interia
  - then think about whether this could be put into a model
- think about poor forecast accuracy (rational expectations) vs. risk
  premia (EH)
  - how do these two components change between tightening and easing?
  - presumably both disappear during tightening episodes
  - RE-wedge is large during easing vs. tightening episodes
- we need to be clear how our work differs from Cieslak (2016)
  - we provide an *explanation*
- asymmetry of monetary policy behavior
  - what is the cause of this asymmetry
  - one idea: asymmetric loss function
    - preference asymmetry
  - maybe that's why more tentative with raising rates, slow steps,
    super-worried about undershooting inflation target
  - other, maybe related idea: MP less effective during easing
    - transmission asymmetry
  - note Orphanides-Wilcox (2002) The opportunistic approach to
    disinflation
    http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-2362.00087/full
  - note also Glenn's paper with Bomfim
    http://www.jstor.org/stable/2601179

Aeimit:
- review literature on state-dependence, asymmetry, policy inertie in
  tightening episodes
- run Taylor rule regressions
me:
- Lena Draeger about policy inertia
- Patrick additional analysis:
  - excess bond returns (3m to 5y) on level, slope, curvature, or just
    on slope
    - hopefully find same pattern
  - forecast errors vs. risk premia
- have Patrick clean up MP classifications
- figure out exactly what Anna's paper is doing

Allan Timmerman?
-> wait until our results are stronger
