* Summary

The paper uses a structural VAR to estimate the effects of the
Federal Reserve's balance sheet policies on the macroeconomy. The
variables in the VAR are inflation, the size of the Fed's balance
sheet, the unemployment rate, the fed funds rate, and the ten-year
Treasury yield. To identify the effects of the balance sheet shock,
a recursive identification scheme is used. The estimates imply the surprising result, which stands in
contrast with the existing literature on this issue, that a positive shock to the Fed's
balance sheet leads to an increase in the unemployment rate,
i.e., that QE was
contractionary.

* Problems with the paper

The paper tries to address an important macroeconomic question,
but it does so only very superficially, with a questionable
econometric approach, and without any good explanation for the
surprising and counterintuitive results. There is no methodological
innovation. The paper does not make a solid
contribution to the empirical macroeconomic literature.

** Econometric identification

There are some serious problems with the assumptions made for
identification of the causal effects of balance sheet shocks. The
authors rely on the approach of imposing short-run restrictions using
a specific recursive ordering of the variable. There is essentially no
discussion of the plausibility of this specific ordering. And there
are inconsistencies in the exposition so that it is not even clear
which ordering is used: The ordering in equation 2 is different from
Table 1 and both are inconsistent with the ordering that underlies the
impulse response functions in Table/Figure 2 (which appears to have FFR
ordered first).

Let's consider the ordering with macro variables first, followed by the
balance sheet variable and finally interest rates. Even if the
size of the balance sheet was an ordinary policy tool this would be
problematic, one of the reasons being that macroeconomic variables
are observed with a lag, and another being that the ordering of the
policy tools is arbitrary but not inconsequential. But the balance
sheet variable is not an ordinary policy tool: its evolution is known
many periods in advance, due to the way QE policies are announced
long before they are actually implemented. Hence, macroeconomic
variables likely respond not only to current but even future changes
in the balance sheet. Usually we want to order the policy tool
last or near the end, so that we have a policy reaction function, but this does not
make sense with the balance sheet variable since its evolution is
determined ahead of time.

These are only some of the reasons that make it appear quite hopeless to identify the effects of
QE using standard recursive ordering. Kilian (2013, chapter in the Handbook of
Research Methods and Applications in Empirical Macroeconomics, Section 2) discusses the
problems of semistructural VAR models of monetary policy with
recursive ordering in detail, and these problems are even more
pronounced for unconventional monetary policies. Kilian also explains
why it is not helpful to "conduct sensitivity analysis based on
alternative orderings of the variables" (p. 519), which the authors
claim to do though without reporting the results. The authors need to face and discuss
their assumptions much more critically, and, to make the analysis more
convincing, come up with a different method for identification.

** Implausible results without theoretical underpinnings

The authors conclude that QE increased the unemployment rate. Even if
taken at face value, there is no theory that is consistent with this
result, and no coherent explanation of this finding and its possible
implications is given in the paper.

However, once the reader reaches page 8 of the paper she learsn that
the increase in the unemployment rate is only 0.09\%. This, of course,
is a miniscule effect. While it is hard to interpret this result given the lack of
detail (e.g., units/ magnitudes) in Section 3, it seems that after all
the estimates do not lead to an economically significant result. From
this point of view, the paper does not find a substantial empirical
result at all.

** Lack of detail and other problems with analysis

Both the exposition and the execution of the empirical analysis lack
detail and depth, and there are inconsistencies. Here are some critical questions left open in
Sections 2 and 3:

- What type of inflation rate is calculated from the CPI?
- What are the units for the balance sheet? Why does the range of the balance sheet
  variable include negative values?
- What type of unit root tests were used to decide on the order of
  integration of the variables? It is not necessary or helpful to
  include all variables in first differences. Interest rates or the
  unemployment rate need to be in levels. More generally, we know from
  Sims, Stock and Watson (1990) that including I(1) variables is not problematic
  for most purposes.
- If the variables are in the VAR in first differences, how could the
  QE variable be so persistent as the top left panel of Table
  (Figure) 2 indicates? It looks like this variable is in fact in
  levels.
- Why are there only four variables in Table/Figure 2? What sample
  period/specification does this figure correspond to?
- How are the confidence intervals in Table 2 constructed? There are
  well-known small-sample problems with standard approaches (such as
  the delta method), and bootstrap methods are usually to be
  preferred.
- How large is a one-standard deviation shock to the balance sheet
  variable?
- What are the specifications estimated in Section 3? In particular,
  what is the ordering?
- In Section 2 the object of interest seems to be the "ultimate"
  increase in the unemployment rate, whereas in Section 3 the focus is
  on the "peak" increase. More precision is necessary.
- Where are the results for the estimates with a different recursive
  ordering of the shocks that are mentioned on page 10? Why did the
  authors chose this particular additional ordering?


* Suggestions

* Smaller points

- The ten-year Treasury yield is not the same as a Treasury bill
  rate. Treasury bills have short maturities of less than one year.
- Figures should not be labeled as tables, and need to include clear
  and legible labels, otherwise it's impossible to interpret the
  quantities.
