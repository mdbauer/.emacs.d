\begin{abstract}
\noindent Insurance companies are unique in that they typically have liabilities far into the future and certainly well beyond the longest maturity bonds trading in the fixed-income markets.  Such long-lived liabilities could be discounted, however, using a yield curve extrapolations based on the information in existing bond yields.  We use standard dynamic Nelson-Siegel (DNS) yield curve models to extrapolate the national risk-free yield curves for Canada, France, Switzerland, and the U.S. We estimate the models with and without the longest-maturity bonds and document modest biases in the extrapolated long bond yields. ***Simulations from alternative, arbitrage-free term structure models also suggest that DNS yield extrapolation errors are relatively small despite being misspecified by construction.*** However, other risk metrics prove to be reasonable with respect to long-term yield forecasts.   Therefore, we recommend using DNS models as a simple tool for generating extrapolated long bond yields for long-term interest rate risk management and as an alternative to the common practice of using ``flat'' forward rate extrapolations.

\section{Introduction}

Insurance companies have liabilities very far into the future.  Some of their products offer customers payments for the rest of their lives starting at a certain date in the future contingent upon survival. Actuarially, such liabilities have expiration dates well beyond thirty years into the future.  Because these claims are not expected for many years and generally cannot be accelerated, their effective maturity can be very long relative to the assets the companies hold. To calculate various portfolio performance and risk measures, such future cash flows need to be discounted using either a risk-free yield curve or an appropriately risky yield curve.  However, it is commonly the case that liquid and readily available yields that could be used for this discounting - such as from government securities - are not available with such long maturities.

In the U.S., Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities are notable examples of asset classes with this limitation.\footnote{The longest maturity for Treasury bonds is $30$ years, although some longer ones were issued in the past (Garbade 2017a,b).}  Although dollar-based interest rate swaps and related derivative contracts are written with maturities longer than thirty years, they are not widely traded and likely affected by transaction-specific features.  In contrast, certain countries - such as Canada, France, and Switzerland - have issued government securities with maturities up to fifty years.  In this paper, we address the question of how to create extrapolations of risk-free yield curves beyond the maximum maturity available - the so-called ``last liquid point'' (LLP) - as required for managing the long-term interest rate risk at insurance companies.

Of course, other techniques are currently in use. The predominant regulatory approach for projecting risk-free yields beyond the LLP is set by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA).  As described in their April 2017 announcement, the so-called ``ultimate forward rate'' (UFR) for each currency's risk free rate is set annually to be the sum of an expected real rate, which is set to the same for all countries, and an expected currency-specific inflation rate. The expected real rate is set as the mean of the annual real GDP growth rates of Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States since 1961.  A currency's expected inflation rate is set equal to its central bank's inflation target, and in the absence of such a target, it is set to $2\%$ by default.  The UFRs are updated annually, but changed only if the latest UFR value differs from the current value by more than $\pm 15$ basis points, at which point the UFR is updated by only 15 basis points.\footnote{Some national insurance regulatory bodies have implemented alternative UFR methodologies within their jurisdictions. See Zigraiova and Jakubik (2017) for a further discussion of the EIOPA algorithm and certain national alternatives.}  This approach has several advantages; i.e., it is clearly grounded in the observable historical data, it encompasses a set of developed economies that represent a large proportion of the economic activity and global government bond issuance, and it allows for dynamic adjustments over time, particularly in light of changes in the so-called ``natural'' rate of interest.\footnote{See Laubach and Williams (2016) as well as by Christensen and Rudebusch (2017) for recent research into this topic.}

Of course, a key shortcoming of this approach is that it is purely backward-looking and does not incorporate the forward-looking market expectations of the yield curve environment.  Market expectations of the risk-free yield curve as expressed in the traded prices of government securities incorporate recent developments regarding monetary policy, exchange rate regimes, fiscal policy, and other drivers of economic and financial outcomes.  Accordingly, many market participants discuss the use of a ``flat forward'' approach in which the yield at the LLP maturity is assumed to be the relevant yield for all greater maturities.  This approach has the advantage of simplicity, but is tied to just one point on the yield curve. However, this approach uses just the information from one point on the yield curve and ignores the remainder of available information.  A wide variety of yield curve models have been developed to encompass the information in the entire yield curve and develop more robust tools for examining yield curve dynamics and generating yield curve projections.  In addition, by introducing a formal model structure, these models can also be used to generate risk measurement and management tools that are critical to the users of these projections.

In this paper, we use the dynamic Nelson-Siegel (DNS) model studied by Diebold and Li (2006) to address these various concerns.\footnote{This paper complements the analysis by Quaedvlieg and Schotman (2016), who discuss the hedging of the long-term liabilities of pension funds based on the DNS model. Engle et al. (2016) propose an alternative yield curve model to generate long-term bond yields that perform well relative to the DNS model.}  The DNS model can easily be used to extrapolate long bond yields beyond the maximum maturity used in model estimation and the market LLP.  The model is structured such that yields are a function of three latent factors and the yield maturity, denoted as $\tau$.  In simple terms, the DNS model allows us to generate a risk-free yield curve using bond prices up to the LLP and then simply extrapolate beyond that maturity.  However, a key concern is whether such extrapolated yields exhibit some sort of bias. If they are systematically too high, the liabilities would be undervalued and likely cause insurance company capital to be set too low to handle their obligations.  On the other hand, if the extrapolated yields are too low, the future liabilities would be overvalued, and insurance companies would be penalized by holding too much capital.

In this paper, we examine the DNS model's ability to extrapolate long-term yields beyond the yields used for estimation separately in four countries: Switzerland, Canada, France, and the U.S.  In particular, we estimate the DNS model on cross-sections of yields with differing maximum maturities up to the longest one available within the national market (i.e., the ``last liquid position'' or (LLP)).  The differences in long-term yield extrapolations across these estimations provide a measure of their relative accuracy.  Our results suggest that such extrapolations are reasonable since the extrapolation errors are relatively small, even with relatively short estimation maturities.  For example, our extrapolations for the fifty-year maturity point on the Swiss yield curve using data up to only the fifteen-year maturity have a mean error of just two basis points and a root mean-squared error of 12 basis points.  This bias shrinks to just a tenth of a basis point when fifty-year projections are based on estimation data up through the thirty-year maturity point.  Similarly small extrapolation biases are observed for the Canadian, French, and U.S. datasets. Biases of this magnitude are likely tolerable in most calculations for such long-term interest rate risks.

To better gauge the magnitude of these bias estimates, we conduct a detailed simulation study based on the Swiss data.  Specifically, we estimate three alternative arbitrage-free Nelson-Siegel (AFNS) models on the Swiss dataset; the three models are a constant volatility AFNS model, a stochastic volatility AFNS model, and a generalized AFNS model that introduces additional factors that better fit long-term yields.  These three sets of parameter estimates are then used to each generate $100$ simulation data samples.  Model errors generated by fitting DNS models to these datasets thus represent how biased the DNS models are.  In terms of magnitude, the average of the mean extrapolation error of the fitted 50-year yields is $-0.39\%$, $-0.30\%$, and $-0.24\%$, when the maximum yield maturity used in the model estimation is $10$ years, $20$ years, and $30$ years, respectively. Once this bias is compared with the general variation in yield levels, it follows that the DNS model generates what must be considered reliable extrapolated $50$-year yields, even if only yields with at most ten years to maturity are used in the model estimation.

Given our focus on measuring interest rate risk, we stress that, thanks to its dynamic  specification, it is straightforward to simulate the DNS model and perform probability-based stress test exercises as done in Christensen et al. (2015) with respect to the Fed's own balance sheet and Christensen and Lopez (2015) with regard to assessing the severity of regulatory rules for interest rate risk.  We apply the DNS model in this way to all four national yield curve datasets and use such probability-based analysis to demonstrate that the bias in the extrapolation errors are much smaller than the yield changes required to generate stressful outcomes in the tails of the relevant yield curve distributions.

Finally, we emphasize the flexibility of the proposed approach based on the DNS model. First, its robust estimation based on the Kalman filter handles missing data in a straightforward way and easily accommodates nonlinear measurements such as bond prices instead of the more commonly used zero-coupon bond yields. Second, the baseline model can be extended to include additional asset classes such as TIPS (see Christensen et al. 2010) and corporate bonds (see Christensen and Lopez 2012). Third, if greater flexibility is needed to fit the observed data, the extension offered by Svensson (1995) can be explored in a similar manner. In short, it is an established, well-tested, rich, and flexible, yet very robust framework that we recommend to use as the foundation for generating reliable extrapolated long bond yields to be used in stress tests and other regulations for assessing and measuring the interest rate risk of insurance companies with long-lived liabilities.  This modeling approach should readily accommodate the balance between stability of a key regulatory parameter (i.e., the UFR) and sensitivity to nearer-term economic and financial developments.  Still, we acknowledge that there are other methods for modeling, projecting, and assessing interest rate risk in the long run; see Engle et al. (2016) as well as the Smith-Wilson modeling approach adapted by EIOPA and reviewed by Gourieroux and Monfort (2015).

Section \ref{sec:DNS_model} follows with an introduction to dynamic Nelson-Siegel model we use in the analysis.  Section \ref{sec:Swiss_Confederation_bond_data_description} provides a detailed discussion of our modeling results and yield curve extrapolations for Switzerland.  Section 4 provides these results for Canada, France, and the U.S., Section 5 provides a comparison of our results with the market-based ``flat forward'' alternative.  Section \ref{sec:simulation_study} details the simulation study we perform on the Swiss data to assess the robustness of our empirical findings. Section \ref{sec:US_Treasury_analysis} applies the DNS model to the four national yield curves for for risk measurement purposes, while Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes and reflects on directions for future research.

\section{The Dynamic Nelson-Siegel Model}
\label{sec:DNS_model}

The Nelson and Siegel (1987) yield curve model assumes that zero-coupon bond yields are functions of the term to maturity $\tau$; specifically,
\begin{equation*}
 y(\tau) =  \beta_1+\beta_2\Big(\frac{1-e^{-\lambda\tau}}{\lambda\tau}\Big) +\beta_3\Big(\frac{1-e^{-\lambda\tau}}{\lambda\tau}-e^{-\lambda\tau}\Big),
\end{equation*}
were $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$, $\beta_3$, and $\lambda$ are parameters. As argued by Diebold and Li (2006), the $\beta$ parameters can be interpreted as level, slope, and curvature factors, respectively, while $\lambda$ determines the maturity at which the peak sensitivity to the curvature factor is located. The loadings of the three factors in the Nelson-Siegel yield curve function are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:factor_loadings_Nelson_Siegel}.

\begin{figure}[t!]

 in the Nelson-Siegel model. The value for $\lambda$ is 0.55 and maturity is measured in years.}}
  \label{fig:factor_loadings_Nelson_Siegel}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Once the model is viewed as a factor model, we are only a small step away from imposing a dynamic structure on the three $\beta$ factors, as per Diebold et al. (2006). The dynamic version of the model is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:DNS_yield_function}
 y_t(\tau) =
 L_t+S_t\bigg(\frac{1-e^{-\lambda\tau}}{\lambda\tau}\bigg)
 +C_t\bigg(\frac{1-e^{-\lambda\tau}}{\lambda\tau}-e^{-\lambda\tau}\bigg),
\end{equation}
where the factors $S_t$, $L_t$, and $C_t$ replace the $\beta$ parameters.  The factor dynamics are assumed to have the following affine structure::
\begin{equation*}
 \left(\begin{array}{c}
 L_t-\mu_L \\
 S_t-\mu_S \\
 C_t-\mu_C \end{array}\right) = \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
 a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
 a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\
 a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} \end{array}\right) \left(\begin{array}{c}
 L_{t-1}-\mu_L \\
 S_{t-1}-\mu_S \\
 C_{t-1}-\mu_C \end{array}\right)+
 \left( \begin{array}{c}
 \eta_t(L) \\
 \eta_t(S) \\
 \eta_t(C) \end{array}\right).
\end{equation*}
Here, the error terms are Gaussian and assumed to have a full covariance matrix $Q$.  The estimated covariance
matrix can be made to be positive definite by imposing a Choleski decomposition $Q = qq',$ where $q$ is a lower triangular matrix. Note that this choice is without loss of generality.

We mostly estimate a simpler version of the dynamic Nelson-Siegel model where the three factors are assumed independent of each other, as per Diebold and Li (2006). In this case, the transition equation in our Kalman filter estimation takes a simpler form
\begin{equation*}
 \left(\begin{array}{c}
 L_t-\mu_L \\
 S_t-\mu_S \\
 C_t-\mu_C \end{array}\right) = \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
 a_{11} & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & a_{22} & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & a_{33} \end{array}\right) \left(\begin{array}{c}
 L_{t-1}-\mu_L \\
 S_{t-1}-\mu_S \\
 C_{t-1}-\mu_C \end{array}\right)+
 \left( \begin{array}{c}
 \eta_t(L) \\
 \eta_t(S) \\
 \eta_t(C) \end{array}\right),
\end{equation*}
and $Q$ is diagonal.

Estimation of the DNS model and related affine term structure models has typically been conducted on zero-coupon yields generated from the underlying government bond prices using a Svensson (1995) model, such as G\"{u}rkaynak et al. (2007) for the U.S. Treasury yield curve. In a recent paper, Andreasen et al. (ACR, 2017) develop an estimation technique based on a ``big data'' approach that uses the underlying bond prices directly.  They found that this one-step approach is more efficient and reduces estimation noise from the Svensson-type interpolation of yields.  In this paper, we use the ACR technique, except for our analysis of the U.S. yield curve in Section ***.

To describe the model implementation, consider the value at time $t$ of a fixed-coupon bond with maturity at $t+\tau$ that pays a coupon $C$ annually. Its price, denoted $P^c_t(\tau,C)$, is simply the sum of its cash flow payments weighted by the zero-coupon bond price function $P_t(\tau)$:
\begin{equation*}
\label{eq:coupon_bond_price}
 P^c_t(\tau,C) = C(t_1-t)P_t(t_1)+ \sum_{j=2}^{N}CP_t(t_j)+P_t(\tau), \quad t<t_1<\ldots<t_N=\tau,
\end{equation*}
where $P_t(\tau)$ is given by
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:zero_coupon_bond_price_function}
 P_t(\tau) = \exp\big(-y_t(\tau)\tau\big),
\end{equation}
and $y_t(\tau)$ is given by equation (\ref{eq:DNS_yield_function}).

Due to the nonlinear relationship between the state variables and the bond prices, the model cannot be estimated with the standard Kalman filter. Instead, we use the extended Kalman filter as in Kim and Singleton (2012). Furthermore, to make the fitted errors comparable across bonds of various maturities, we scale each bond price by its duration, which is calculated before estimation. Thus, the measurement equation for the bond prices in the Kalman filter estimation is of the form:
\begin{equation*}
 \frac{P^i_t(t^i_0,\tau^i)}{D^i_t(t^i_0,\tau^i)} = \frac{\widehat{P}^i_t(t^i_0,\tau^i)}{D^i_t(t^i_0,\tau^i)} + \varepsilon^i_t,
\end{equation*}
where $\widehat{P}^i_t(t^i_0,\tau^i)$ is the model-implied price of bond $i$ and $D^i_t(t^i_0,\tau^i)$ is its duration.

Finally, the disturbances in the measurement and transition equations are assumed to be independent. Thus, the error structure is given by
\begin{equation*}
 \left(\begin{array}{c}
 \eta_t \\
 \varepsilon_t \end{array}\right) \sim
 N\left[\left(\begin{array}{c}
 0 \\
 0 \end{array}\right),\left(\begin{array}{cc}
 Q & 0 \\
 0 & H \end{array}\right)\right],
\end{equation*}
where $H = \sigma^2_\varepsilon I $. Throughout this paper, the reported standard deviations for the estimated parameters are calculated as
\begin{equation*}
 \widehat{\Sigma}=\frac{1}{T}\Bigg[\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T\frac{\partial
 \log l_t(\widehat{\theta})}{\partial \theta}\frac{\partial
 \log l_t(\widehat{\theta})}{\partial \theta}'\Bigg]^{-1},
\end{equation*}
where $\widehat{\theta}$ denotes the estimated model parameter set.

The market for Swiss Confederation bonds is ideal for our analysis since it is of sufficient size for use of the ACR estimation technique, and it has long-term bond issuance with an LLP of 50 years. The data is collected daily by staff at the SNB and is available back to the 1980s.\footnote{We thank Nikola Mirkov and Thomas Nitschka for sharing the data.} However, an inspection of the data reveals that the early part of the sample is characterized by many stale or erratic prices. Thus, we start the monthly estimation in January 1993, after the data appear to be systematically reliable across all available bonds.\footnote{While the bond data are available at daily frequency, we make our analysis with monthly data to facilitate the empirical implementation. Due to the high persistence of long bond prices, a switch to a higher frequency would not qualitatively change any of our results.} Furthermore, for factor identification in the various models we consider, we need at least five bonds to be trading on each day in the sample. As a consequence, we track a few select bonds that were issued before January 1993 and appear to have systematically reliable prices. These considerations combined lead us to focus on the universe of Swiss Confederation bonds listed in Table \ref{tab:Swiss_Confederation_bond_universe_sample_statistics}. Importantly, the sample contains every Swiss Confederation bond issued since 1993, which is a total of 54 bonds.

Figure \ref{fig:maturity_distribution_Swiss_Confederation_bonds} shows the maturity distribution of the universe of Swiss Confederation bonds across time from January 1993 to January 2016. The vertical dashed grey lines indicate the start and end dates for our sample, while the horizontal solid grey lines indicate the top and bottom of the maturity range considered. The top of the range equals 50 years and is determined by the longest bond maturity issued by the Swiss Confederation, while the bottom of the range is fixed at three months to avoid erratic prices for bonds as they approach maturity.

Figure \ref{fig:number_of_Swiss_Confederation_bonds} shows the number of bonds in our sample at each point
in time. We note that the total number of outstanding bonds have been fairly stable since the mid-1990s.
At the end of our sample period, there was a total of 22 Swiss Confederation bonds outstanding.
The figure also shows the available number of bonds when the analysis is restricted to bonds with at most 15 years to maturity at issuance. This maturity limit cuts the number of bonds in half during the post-crisis period, as the Swiss Confederation took advantage of the low interest rate environment and tilted its issuance towards longer-term bonds.

Figure \ref{fig:yield_to_maturity_Swiss_Confederation_bonds} shows the Swiss Confederation bond prices converted into yield to maturity. Here, we note the clear trend towards ever lower yield levels during this 22-year period. Also notable is the fact that short- and medium-term Swiss yields have been in negative territory since 2012. This fact explains why we do not consider term structure models that impose a lower bound for the bond yields, such as Chirsitensen and Rudebusch (2015), as no lower bound appears to yet exist for Swiss yield data. Finally, around the lower trend, there is clear business cycle variation in the shape of the yield curve, suggesting that three factors or more are required to capture the yield curve dynamics during the sample period.

\subsection{Estimation Results}

For our yield curve extrapolation, we estimate the DNS model using samples of bond prices with increasing maximum maturities. In the first estimation, only bonds with 15 years or less to maturity at issuance are included.  The maximum maturity is increased incrementally to 20 years, 25 years, and 30 years, before we end with an estimation using all bonds, including the two 50-year bonds. In discussing the model fit, it is sufficient to look at the most parsimonious specification of the DNS model with independent factors as the results are not sensitive to the dynamic specification.

\caption{\textbf{Estimated Dynamic Parameters for DNS Models of Swiss Bond Prices}
\newline
{\small The table shows the estimated parameters of the $A$ matrix, $\mu$ vector, and diagonal $Q$ matrix for
the independent-factors DNS model estimated on samples with varying maximum bond maturity.
 The estimated values of $\lambda$ are $\lambda_{15}=0.4829$ (0.0104), $\lambda_{20}=0.3889$ (0.0046), $\lambda_{25}=0.3724$ (0.0038), $\lambda_{30}=0.3836$ (0.0034), and $\lambda_{50}=0.3662$ (0.0029). The numbers in parentheses are the estimated parameter standard deviations.}}
 \label{tab:est_parameters_DNS_models}
\end{table}

The estimated parameters from these five model estimations are reported in Table \ref{tab:est_parameters_DNS_models}.
In general, the level factor is estimated to be very persistent with its AR parameter (i.e., $A_{11}$) being very close to a unit root. A similar pattern is observed for the slope factor; i.e., the coefficient $A_{22}$. On the other hand, the curvature factor tends to become somewhat less persistent as the maximum maturity in the sample increases, as seen by the declining value of the $A_{33}$ parameter. A mechanical explanation for this pattern is that with more bonds in the sample to fit, there is more of a burden on the curvature factor to pick up any slack in the intermediate maturities as the level and slope factors are dedicated to fitting the short and long ends of the sample. As the maximum maturity in the sample is extended, the segment of the yield curve where this slack shows up will tend to increase in maturity and be a little more erratic. The model estimation tries to accommodate this mechanical change in the underlying data by making the curvature factor less persistent and lowering the value of $\lambda$. The latter change implies that the peak of the hump of the curvature factor loading in the yield function is located at a later maturity, and it also makes the loading of the slope factor in the yield function have a slower decay. Finally, for the volatility parameters, the patterns are a little more erratic. However, there is some tendency for the volatility of all three factors to decline as the maximum maturity increases.

  \label{fig:estimated_level_slope_curvature_DNS_models}
\end{figure}


Figure \ref{fig:estimated_level_slope_curvature_DNS_models} shows the three estimated state variables from all five model estimations. All three factors remain qualitatively similar across the model estimations. Hence, they appear to have only modest sensitivity to the choice of the maximum bond maturity. The most notable variation is observed in Figure \ref{fig:sub:estimated_level_factors_various_DNS_models}, which compares the estimated level factors. The estimation using at most 15-year bonds delivers somewhat deviating values for $L_t$ during the 1998-2002 period.
Beyond that it is challenging to detect any material systematic differences regarding the filtered state variables.
This observation is consistent with the minor differences in the estimated model parameters discussed above.

 \label{tab:summary_statistics_fitted_yield_errors_DNS_models}
\end{center}
\end{table}


Table \ref{tab:summary_statistics_fitted_yield_errors_DNS_models} reports the summary statistics for the fit to all bonds in the sample from the five model estimations.
We stress that for the estimations with maximum bond maturity less than 50 years, the statistics for the bonds not included in their respective estimations
measure the model's ability to extrapolate rather than to fit the prices of those securities.
At the bottom of the table, the statistics for all errors combined are reported where we see the expected pattern that it is harder to fit yields out of sample than in sample
as the error increases as more and more long bonds are dropped from the sample.
Still, it is the case that even when the model is estimated using at most 15-year bonds, it still gives a satisfactory overall fit to the data with a mean error of 2 basis points and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 12 basis points. However, if we focus narrowly on the fit of the two 50-year bonds highlighted in bold in the table,
we see a fairly consistent pattern of improved fit as the maximum bond maturity in the model estimation is increased.
With all bonds included, the model is able to fit these two bonds with almost no bias on average and RMSEs of 12 and 9 basis points, respectively.

To give a sense of the variation across time in the model fit,
Figure \ref{fig:fitted_error_DNS_model_all_bonds} shows the time series of the fitted errors of the 54 individual bonds from the estimation with all bonds included.
Two things stand out. First, there are brief periods such as the peak of the financial crisis during which the model faces challenges in fitting the data.
Second, since 2010 with few exceptions, the model has been able to price all bonds with an error of less than 20 basis points.
As parts of the Swiss Confederation bond curve have been in negative territory since 2012, this demonstrates that the DNS model continues to
deliver very accurate fit even in negative yield environments.

   {\footnotesize Illustration of the maturity distribution of the Canadian government fixed-coupon bonds considered.
   The grey rectangle indicates the subsample used in the estimation, which is characterized by two sample choices:
   (1) sample limited to the period from January 31, 2000, to April 29, 2016;
   (2) censoring of the price of each bond when it has less than three months to maturity.}}
      \label{fig:maturity_distribution_Canadian_bonds}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The available universe of individual Canadian government fixed-coupon bonds since January 2000 is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:maturity_distribution_Canadian_bonds}. These bonds are all marketable, non-callable bonds denominated in Canadian dollars that pay a fixed rate of interest semi-annually.\footnote{This information is available at http://www.fin.gc.ca/invest/instru-eng.asp} We note that the Bank of Canada systematically has been issuing two-, five-, ten-, and thirty-year fixed-coupon bonds during this period. In addition, it has repeatedly issued three-year bonds since 2008. For our analysis, the key thing to note is that a single fifty-year bond was issued in April 2014.
This structure to the issuance pattern invites a split of the data into three buckets: a sample of bonds with ten years or less to maturity, another sample of bonds with thirty years or less to maturity, and a sample containing all bonds.

      \label{fig:yield_to_maturity}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:yield_to_maturity} shows the time series of the yields to maturity implied by the observed bond prices. First, we note the downward trend of the general yield level since 2000. The ten-year yield dropped from above 6 percent to below 2 percent over the shown period. Second, as in U.S. Treasury yield data, there is clear business cycle variation in the shape of the yield curve around this lower trend. Finally, regarding the important question of a lower bound, the Bank of Canada has yet to lower its conventional policy rate to zero, and the bond yields in the data have remained well above zero throughout the sample period. In their analysis of this data, Andreasen et al. (2017) do consider shadow-rate models with a lower bound of zero, but do not report any major improvements in model performance from such refinements. Therefore, we leave this issue for future research.

Figure \ref{fig:estimated_level_slope_curvature_Canadian_DNS_models} shows the three estimated state variables from all three Canadian DNS model estimations. In general, all three factors remain qualitatively similar across the model estimations. Hence, they appear to have only modest sensitivity to the choice of the maximum bond maturity.

To give a sense of the variation across time in the model fit, Figure \ref{fig:fitted_error_Canadian_DNS_model_all_bonds} shows the time series of the fitted errors of the 105 individual bonds from the estimation with all bonds included. Two things stand out. First, there are brief periods such as the peak of the financial crisis during which the model faces challenges in fitting the data.
Second, since 2010 with few exceptions, the model has been able to price all bonds with an error of less than 20 basis points. This demonstrates that the DNS model is able to deliver a very accurate fit to this data in the current low-yield environment.


Summary statistics for the fitted errors of the individual bonds are reported in Tables \ref{tab:summary_statistics_fitted_yield_errors_Canadian_DNS_models_I} and \ref{tab:summary_statistics_fitted_yield_errors_Canadian_DNS_models_II}. Note that the fit of the fifty-year bond issued in 2014 is only modestly worse when at most ten-year bonds are included in the model estimation. This is consistent with the results reported for the Swiss Confederation bond data.

\subsection{Analysis of French Government Bond Prices}

   The grey rectangle indicates the subsample used throughout the paper and characterized by two sample choices:
   (1) sample limited to the period from January 29, 1999, to December 30, 2016;
   (2) censoring of the price of each bond when it has less than three months to maturity.}}
      \label{fig:maturity_distribution_French_bonds}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The available universe of individual French government fixed-coupon bonds since January 1999 is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:maturity_distribution_French_bonds}. These bonds are all marketable, non-callable bonds denominated in euros that pay a fixed rate of interest annually. We note that the France Tr\'esor systematically has been issuing two-, five-, ten-, fifteen- and thirty-year fixed-coupon bonds during this period. For our analysis, the key thing to note is that a total of three fifty-year bonds have been issued since 2005. This issuance pattern invites a split of the data into four buckets: a sample of bonds with ten years or less to maturity, another sample of bonds with fifteen years or less to maturity, a third sample of bonds with thirty years or less to maturity, and a final sample containing all bonds.

   (2) censoring of the price of each bond when it has less than three months to maturity.}}
      \label{fig:yield_to_maturity_French_government_bonds}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:yield_to_maturity_French_government_bonds} shows the time series of the yields to maturity implied by the observed French bond prices.
First, we note the downward trend of the general yield level since 1999.
The ten-year yield dropped from around 4.5 percent to close zero over the shown period.
Second, as in U.S. Treasury yield data, there is clear business cycle variation in the shape of the yield curve
around this lower trend.
Finally, regarding the important question of a lower bound, the European Central Bank has lowered its conventional policy rate deep into negative territory. As a consequence, short- and medium-term French bond yields are significantly negative at the end of our sample.
Thus, it is not clear that one would need to impose a lower bound to model this data.
%However, we include a shadow-rate model with a lower bound of zero in our analysis and the results are very close to those reported for the Gaussian model, so empirically it is challenging to determine whether an unconstrained Gaussian model approach is more appropriate than a model approach enforcing zero as a lower bound.

\caption{\textbf{Estimated Dynamic Parameters for DNS Models of French Government Fixed-Coupon Bond Prices}
\newline
{\footnotesize The table shows the estimated parameters of the $A$ matrix, $\mu$ vector, and diagonal $Q$ matrix for
the independent-factors DNS model estimated on samples of French government fixed-coupon bond prices with varying maximum bond maturity.
 The estimated values of $\lambda$ are $\lambda_{10}=0.4328$ (0.0043), $\lambda_{15}=0.4042$ (0.0017), $\lambda_{30}=0.4404$ (0.0008), and $\lambda_{50}=0.4484$ (0.0007). The numbers in parentheses are the estimated parameter standard deviations.}}
 \label{tab:est_parameters_French_DNS_models}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:est_parameters_French_DNS_models} contains the estimated dynamic parameters from all four DNS model estimations
performed with the French government bond price data.
The key observation is the stability of the estimated parameters as the maximum maturity of bond included in the estimation is increased.
The primary reason for this result is that most of the parameters are determined primarily from the sample length rather than the cross sectional composition,
which is a very encouraging result from the perspective of using the DNS model for yield curve extrapolations
as the dynamic properties of the model are unlikely to change whether or not very long-term bonds are available and included in the model estimation.

  \label{fig:estimated_level_slope_curvature_French_DNS_models}
\end{figure}


Figure \ref{fig:estimated_level_slope_curvature_French_DNS_models} shows the three estimated state variables from all four French DNS model estimations.
In general, the pattern is that all three factors remain qualitatively similar across all model estimations.
Hence, they appear to have only modest sensitivity to the choice of the maximum bond maturity.
In short, it is challenging to detect any material systematic differences regarding either the estimated model parameters or the filtered state variables.

To give a sense of the variation across time in the model fit,
Figure \ref{fig:fitted_error_French_DNS_model_all_bonds} shows the time series of the fitted errors of the 109 individual bonds from the estimation with all French government bonds included.
Overall, the model fit is very satisfactory with only a very small number of bonds being notably mispriced at any given point in time.
And even those errors are rarely larger than 25 basis points in size.

Finally, regarding the pricing of the fifty-year bonds, we note that, as long as the DNS model is estimated using bonds with maturities
up to thirty years, the extrapolated fit is only modestly less accurate than the fit obtained with all bonds included in the model estimation.
This again confirms the findings reported in the main text based on the Swiss Confederation bond data regarding the accuracy of the DNS model
in extrapolating long bond yields.

As noted earlier, our analysis of the U.S. Treasury yield curve is not based on individual bonds. The specific Treasury yields used are instead zero-coupon yields constructed by the method described in G\"urkaynak at al. (2007)
with the following 11 maturities: three-month, six-month, one-year, two-year, three-year, five-year, seven-year, ten-year, fifteen-year, twenty-year, and thirty-year.\footnote{The Board of Governors in Washington D.C. updates the factors and parameters of this method daily, see also the related website http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2006/index.html} The sample is limited to weekly observations (Fridays) over the period from January 6, 1995, to October 14, 2016. Figure \ref{fig:observed_Treasury_yields} illustrates the constructed time series of the three-month, two-year, five-year, ten-year, and thirty-year Treasury zero-coupon yields.

Figure \ref{fig:estimated_level_slope_curvature_US_DNS_models} shows the three estimated state variables from all three U.S. DNS model estimations. In general, the pattern is that all three factors remain qualitatively similar across all model estimations. Hence, we only observe modest sensitivity to the choice of the maximum bond maturity. Similarly, the parameter estimates in Table \ref{tab:est_parameters_US_DNS_models} do not vary much across the different estimation samples.  A likely explanation is that the algorithms used in generating these yields smooth out a large degree of idiosyncratic bond variation, which likely contributes to much less data variation in this dataset as we introduce longer maturity bonds into the estimation.

Table \ref{tab:fiited_error_US_Treasury_DNS_model} presents the fitted errors across the estimations. As expected, the RMSE measure decreases as the sample maturity is extended.  Notably, the mean error does not improve much from the ten-year maturity sample to the 20-year maturity sample, although the RMSE does decline. Focusing in on the LLP 30-year yield, the mean error of $-18$ basis points for the shortest maturity sample is reasonably close to the $-13$ basis point error observed in-sample for the longest maturity sample. This result suggests that the DNS extrapolation error in the U.S. Treasury data is a bit larger than observed for the other national datasets; however, it remains relatively small relative to a full-sample estimation and thus reasonably useful for extrapolation purposes.

\section{Comparisons with existing alternatives}
\label{sec:flat_forward_comparison}

It seems to be a fairly common practice among market participants to price illiquid longer-term bonds using so-called ``flat forward'' rate curves. In practice, given a forward rate curve estimated from bond prices with a maximum maturity $\tau_{max}$, forward rates for longer maturities are simply set equal to the forward rate at maturity $\tau_{max}$. Formally, the extrapolated forward rate curve is given by
\begin{equation*}
 f(\tau) = \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
 \widehat{f}(\tau) & \text{for } \tau \le \tau_{max}, \\
 \widehat{f}(\tau_{max})  & \text{for } \tau > \tau_{max}, \end{array}\right.
\end{equation*}
where $\widehat{f}(\tau)$ represents fitted forward rates.

      \label{fig:fitted_and_extrapolated_forward_curves_DNS_model}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

For the Swiss dataset, Figure \ref{fig:fitted_and_extrapolated_forward_curves_DNS_model} shows the fitted and extrapolated forward rates as of January 29, 2016, as implied by the DNS model. First, note the similarity in the forward rates for maturities up to ten years, which is due to the fact that all the estimations are fitting the same data in this maturity range equally well. Second and more importantly for our analysis, we observe that most extrapolations are very similar to the fitted estimation based on using all the available data; i.e., the estimates for $\tau_{max} = 50$. The exception is the estimation based on bonds up to the 15-year maturity, which generates extrapolated yields that are more than $25$ basis points below the observed longer-term yields.

Thus, a yield curve extrapolation technique based on the DNS model is consistent with the ``\textit{flat forwards}'' approach. Combined with the small extrapolated errors for the two 50-year bonds reported in Table \ref{tab:summary_statistics_fitted_yield_errors_DNS_models} for the four estimations where these bonds are excluded, our empirical evidence suggests that the DNS model extrapolation approach is roughly equivalent to the ``\textit{flat forwards}'' approach. However, the modeling approach provides us with a richer framework for risk management purposes (i.e., moving beyond just the first moments of the data used for standard pricing purposes), which we explore in Section ***.\footnote{Note that this result may suggest that investors price these long bonds using flat forwards. In theory, this would imply that the bonds are mispriced. However, in practice it is not possible to short those long bonds and go long shorter bonds without assuming some roll-over risk, and once that is taken into consideration there may not be exploitable mispricing in the Swiss Confederation bond market. Alternatively, the underpricing of the long bonds could reflect liquidity premiums that investors demand as compensation for potentially facing difficulties in selling those bonds back to the market in the future.}

\section{Risk Management Applications}
\label{sec:risk_management_applications}

While point estimates of longer-term yields are needed for the projections and pricing exercises discussed above, projections of other elements characterizing the yield curve are needed for risk management purposes.  In this section, we examine the properties of the proposed DNS model with respect to generating reasonable yield curve scenarios that extend to include longer-term yields. To do so, we estimate the DNS model on the four national datasets, identify a preferred dynamic specification, and simulate it to make a probability-based assessment of the interest rate risk of yields as advocated by Christensen et al. (2015) as well as Christensen and Lopez (2015). Our analysis shows that the extrapolation errors of longer-term bond yields documented in the previous section are small relative to the yield changes required to observe stressful events in the tails of bond yield distributions.

\subsection{Motivation}
%\label{subsec:Treasury_bond_yield_data}

Insurance companies and other portions of the financial industry must deal with managing long-horizon portfolios, especially those with fixed-income bonds.  Accurate models of yield curve forecasts are valuable, but accurate risk measurement is also of value for gauging and managing the risk in these positions. As clearly noted by Engle et al. (2016), mean or median forecasts are not the only objects of interest; measures of extreme outcomes - such as value-at-risk (VaR) estimates that gauge the extent of possible tail outcomes - are also of importance.

Another useful risk measurement outcome is determining the range of possible yield curve values based on scenario analysis; that is, a modeling framework can be used simulate many possible future outcomes and sketch out the range of possible outcomes.  As highlighted in Christensen et al. (2012, 2015) as well as Christensen and Lopez (2015), such scenarios can be readily generated with an estimated model and used to generate probabilities of specific interest rate outcomes or related outcomes. In this section, we generate yield curve scenarios and ground their reasonableness with comparisons with yield forecasts from surveys of professional forecasters. The main outcome is to show that the ranges of interest rate scenarios arising from a standard DNS model are sufficiently large for standard scenario-based risk management purposes.  Our analysis also suggests that the biases observed in Section \ref{sec:Swiss_Confederation_bond_data_description} for DNS point estimates remain small in absolute terms and certainly small in terms relative to the range of scenario outcomes.  Accordingly, DNS modeling and extrapolation of longer-term yields, even those beyond the LLP, provides a richer set of useful diagnostics than simply using backward-looking, regulatory calibrations and simple extensions of the LLP yield.

For this simulation exercise, we estimate the unrestricted DNS model on the full set of Swiss bonds. **Why re-do the estimation?*** The estimated parameters are reported in Table \ref{tab:est_parameters_DNS_model_Swiss_bond_prices}. To gauge the model fit across time, Figure \ref{fig:fitted_error_Swiss_DNS_model_all_bonds} shows the time series of the fitted errors of the 54 individual bonds from the estimation with all bonds included. Two things stand out. First, there are brief periods such as the peak of the financial crisis during which the model faces challenges in fitting the data. Second, since 2010 with few exceptions, the model has been able to price all bonds with an error of less than 20 basis points. As parts of the Swiss Confederation bond curve have been in negative territory since 2012, this demonstrates that the DNS model continues to deliver very accurate fit even in negative yield environments. For all bonds combined, the RMSE is 9.37 basis points.

To measure the degree of yield variation DNS model dynamics can generate, we simulate 10,000 factor paths over a three-year horizon using as conditioning information the estimated parameters and factor values as of December 30, 2016. To keep things simple, we focus on the simulated paths for two yields: (1) the three-month yield, which is the model equivalent for the three-month Swiss franc LIBOR rate targeted by the Swiss National Bank (SNB), and (2) the projected ten-year Swiss Confederation bond yield, which is a widely used benchmark for many Swiss fixed-income securities.

For the short rate projections, Figure \ref{fig:three_month_yield_projections_Swiss_DNS_model} shows DNS projections for the three-month yield as of January 29, 2016. The figure shows the median, $5$th, and $95$th percentile values for the simulated three-month yield over a three-year forecast horizon.\footnote{Note that the lines do not represent short rate paths from a single simulation run over the forecast horizon; instead, they delineate the distribution of all simulation outcomes at a given point in time. For example, the DNS-projected three-month yield as of *** ranges from *** at the 5th percentile to *** at its 95th percentile.} The median projections indicate a continued gradual normalization of monetary policy with the three-month yield reaching a level close to zero by the spring of 2019. The upper $95$th percentile rises more rapidly, breaching zero in mid-2016 and approaching 2 percent at three years out.  The lower $5$th percentile suggests a further drop in the three-month yield to about $-2$ percent. Note the increasing width of the $[5\%, 95\%]$ range. By the spring of 2019, there is almost a 400 basis point difference between the top and the bottom of this range, which suggests a reasonably large degree of yield variation.

      \label{fig:ten_year_yield_projections_Swiss_DNS_model}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Next, we focus on the simulated paths for the ten-year yield, which is a key benchmark for most financial institutions.\footnote{Results for the 50-year yields are qualitatively similar and therefore not shown.} Figure
\ref{fig:ten_year_yield_projections_Swiss_DNS_model} illustrates its median and $[5\%, 95\%]$ range at each point in time from the simulated interest rate scenarios. The ten-year projections suggest that the likely range of outcomes at a three-year horizon is quite wide with a width of almost 300 basis points, which is only marginally smaller than the corresponding range of projected short rates. The median simulated ten-year yield indicates a continued gradual normalization, reaching zero at the end of the projection horizon. The upper 95th percentile rises more rapidly and reaches 5 percent at three years out, while the lower 5th percentile represents a return to the very low interest rate environment that prevailed in the immediate years after the financial crisis.

To provide perspective for these outcome projections, we compare them to the Consensus Forecasts survey conducted as of February 8, 2016.\footnote{Consensus Forecasts is produced by FocusEconomics using individual forecasts from expert panels for the major world economies.} The survey contains 11 responses to questions about the level of the ten-year Swiss Confederation bond yields at month-end May 2016 and February 2017. Figure \ref{fig:ten_year_yield_projections_Swiss_DNS_model} shows the consensus forecasts as well as the maximum and minimum response to those two questions. We note that the model-implied median projection is slightly lower than the path of the consensus survey forecast. Furthermore, the top of the projected range is below the maximum survey response. This alignment of yield projections is quite encouraging regarding the model's performance; i.e., the model's cloe match with the projections by professional forecasters when it is using a ``yields-only'' approach speaks well of its forecasting abilities.  Correspondingly, the model's usefulness for risk management purposes seems quite high.

In Figure \ref{fig:key_simulated_Swiss_yield_curves_Jan_2016}, we illustrate the entire yield curve corresponding to the three percentiles of the ten-year yield projections for the end of December 2019 (i.e., the rightmost projection point in the graph), as shown in Figure \ref{fig:ten_year_yield_projections_Swiss_DNS_model}. Note the wide variation in the yield curve shapes that the model suggests may occur with 90\% probability over the next three years. For example, the yield curve corresponding to the median point represents ***. This figure underscores that the DNS model is able to generate quite a wide range of yield outcomes even at the relatively short projection horizons typically considered in regulatory stress tests of financial institutions.

As in the Swiss case, we simulate 10,000 factor paths over a three-year horizon using as conditioning information the estimated parameters and factor values as of April 29, 2016.

The upper $95$th percentile rises more rapidly and reaches 4 percent at three years out, while the lower $5$th percentile represents a movement into negative policy rates in early 2017. Furthermore, note the width of the $[5\%, 95\%]$ range. By mid-2019, there is a 500 basis point difference between the top and the bottom of this range.

\ref{fig:ten_year_yield_projections_Canadian_DNS_model} illustrates the median and $[5\%, 95\%]$ range of the ten-year yield at each point in time from the simulated interest rate scenarios. The median simulated ten-year yield indicates a steady, very gradual normalization of the long-term interest rate environment. The upper 95th percentile rises more rapidly and reaches 4 percent at three years out, while the lower 5th percentile represents a further decline from the already very low current interest rate environment. To provide perspective for the model projections, we compare them to the Consensus Forecasts survey performed on May 9, 2016. It contains 15 responses to questions about the level of the ten-year Canadian government bond yield at the end of August 2016 and the end of May 2017, respectively.
In Figure \ref{fig:ten_year_yield_projections_Canadian_DNS_model}, we show the consensus forecasts as well as the maximum and minimum response to those two questions. Note that the model-implied median projection is very close to the path of the consensus forecast path. Furthermore, the $[5\%, 95\%]$ range of the projected ten-year yields encompasses the range of the survey forecasts. More importantly, the projections suggest that the likely range of outcomes at a three-year horizon is quite wide at more than 300 basis points, which is only marginally smaller than the corresponding range of projected short rates.

The upper $95$th percentile indicates a rise to roughly 2 percent at three years out, while the lower $5$th percentile represents further rate cuts into negative territory that pushes short rates below -2 percent by late 2019. Furthermore, the width of the range reaches 400 basis points by the end of 2019.

Next, we focus on the simulated paths for the ten-year Treasury yield, which is a key benchmark for most financial institutions.\footnote{Results for the 50-year yields are qualitatively similar and therefore not shown.} Figure
\ref{fig:ten_year_yield_projections_French_DNS_model} illustrates the median and $[5\%, 95\%]$ range of the ten-year yield at each point in time from the simulated interest rate scenarios. The median simulated ten-year yield indicates a continued gradual normalization of the long-term interest rate environment. The upper 95th percentile rises more rapidly and surpasses 3 percent at three years out, while the lower 5th percentile represents a further decline from the already historically low levels observed at the start of the projection period.

To provide perspective for the model projections, we compare them to the Consensus Forecasts survey performed on January 9, 2017. It contains 16 and 14 responses to questions about the level of the ten-year French government bond yield at the end of April 2017 and the end of January 2018, respectively. In Figure \ref{fig:ten_year_yield_projections_French_DNS_model}, we show the consensus forecasts as well as the maximum and minimum response to those two questions. We note that the model-implied median projection is slightly more optimistic than the path of the survey's consensus forecasts. Furthermore, the bottom of the $[5\%, 95\%]$ range of the projected ten-year yields is above the lowest projections in the Consensus Forecasts survey. Thus, a minority of the professional forecasters in the Consensus Forecasts panel for France share a really pessimistic view about the near-term prospects for the French economy that the DNS model may fail to detect as it is solely relying on the information contained in French government bond prices. Still, the projections suggest that the likely range of outcomes at a three-year horizon is quite wide with a width of almost 300 basis points, which is only marginally smaller than the corresponding range of projected short rates.

In Figure \ref{fig:key_simulated_French_yield_curves_Dec_2016}, we illustrate the entire yield curve corresponding to the three percentiles of the ten-year yield projections for the end of December 2019 shown in Figure
\ref{fig:ten_year_yield_projections_French_DNS_model}. Note the wide variation in the shape of the yield curve that the model suggests may occur with 90\% probability over the next three years. This figure underscores that the DNS model is able to generate quite a wide range of yield outcomes even at the relatively short projection horizons typically considered in regulatory stress tests of financial institutions.

\end{figure}

To give a sense of the amount of yield variation the DNS model dynamics can generate, we simulate 10,000 factor paths over a three-year horizon using as conditioning information the estimated parameters and factor values as of December 30, 2016. To keep things simple, we focus on the simulated paths for the short rate, which is the model equivalent for the overnight federal funds rate targeted by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), and on the projected ten-year U.S. Treasury yields, which is a widely used benchmark for many U.S. fixed-income securities such as MBS.

To provide some insight into the variation in the resulting short rate projections, Figure \ref{fig:short_rate_projections_US_Treasury_DNS_model} compares forecasts of the short rate as of December 30, 2016, from the DNS model. The figure shows the median, $5$th, and $95$th percentile values for the simulated short rate for a three-year forecast horizon.\footnote{Note that the lines do not represent short rate paths from a single simulation run over the forecast horizon; instead, they delineate the distribution of all simulation outcomes at a given point in time.} The median simulated short rate indicates a continued gradual normalization of monetary policy with the short rate reaching a level slightly above 2 percent by the end of 2019. The upper $95$th percentile rises more rapidly and reaches 5 percent at three years out, while the lower $5$th percentile represents a return to the zero lower bound in early 2019. Also shown are the lower and upper quartiles as well as the median of FOMC members' own expectations about appropriate future target rates for the overnight federal funds rate taken from their Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) released on December 14, 2016, following the December 2016 FOMC meeting. Given that the FOMC has the authority to set this target rate, these projections represent a useful benchmark for assessing the reasonableness of the model-implied projections. We note that the model-implied median projection is indeed very close to the median projection among the policy makers on the FOMC. Furthermore, note the width of the $[5\%, 95\%]$ range. By the end of 2019, there is a 500 basis point difference between the top and the bottom of this range.

The upper 95th percentile rises more rapidly and reaches 5 percent at three years out, while the lower 5th percentile represents a return to the very low interest rate environment that prevailed in the immediate years after the financial crisis.

Again, to provide perspective for the model projections, we compare them to survey forecasts, this time we use the long-term ten-year Treasury yield forecasts included in the Blue Chip Financial Forecasts survey released on December 1, 2016. In Figure \ref{fig:ten_year_yield_projections_US_Treasury_DNS_model}, we show the Blue Chip consensus forecast as well as the averages of the bottom ten lowest and top ten highest forecasts. We note that the model-implied median projection is close to the path of the Blue Chip consensus forecast. Furthermore, the range of the projected ten-year yields fully encompass the considered range of forecasts in the Blue Chip survey.
More importantly, the projections suggest the likely range of outcomes at a three-year horizon is quite wide with a width of about 400 basis points similar to what we saw for the projected short rates.

This figure underscores that the DNS model is able to generate quite a wide range of yield outcomes even at the relatively short projection horizons typically considered in regulatory stress tests of financial institutions.

Although the distribution of the generated scenarios could be evaluated in a more formal and comprehensive way as in Engle et al. (2016), the key takeaway for the analysis in this note is that, thanks to the estimated high persistence of the level factor, the DNS model is able to generate quite a wide range of future interest rate environments despite its Gaussian dynamics. Thus, it is not clear that stochastic yield volatility needs to be incorporated into the model to achieve simulated outcomes that are adequately stressful with a reasonable likelihood as also noted by Christensen et al. (2015). Furthermore, this highlights that if simulations of the DNS model are used to generate yield curves for scenarios in stress tests of insurance companies, any potential bias in the extrapolated long bond yields is easily dwarfed by the variation in the overall yield level that the estimated model dynamics are able to generate over the projection horizons typically considered in stress test exercises. Thus, overall extrapolation errors of long bond yields would only represent a very modest distortion to the true yield curves in the relevant stressful interest rate scenarios.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Summary}

The empirical results shown in this section highlight two insights.  First, the yield curve scenarios that can be generated from DNS models across all four national datasets are reasonable with respect to the yield curve projections from surveys of professional forecasters.  Second, the extrapolation bias discussed earlier is sufficiently small that it does not interfere with the usefulness of the scenario projections.  These two results - combined with the ease of DNS model estimation and applicability across countries and datasources (i.e., individual bond prices and composite yields at various maturities) - provide further evidence on the reasonableness of this approach for yield curve risk management, including at the longer-term maturities that extend beyond the maturities of traded securities.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we analyze the ability of a standard term structure model, namely the DNS model of Diebold and Li (2006), to generate extrapolated long bond yields from the information in bond yields of shorter maturity.

First, we estimate the DNS model on data from the Swiss Confederation bond market where 50-year bonds have been trading for many years. The results indicate that, indeed, the DNS model performs well at extrapolating those 50-year yields using only the information in prices of bonds with maturities up to 30 years. Analysis of Canadian and French government bond prices confirms these empirical findings.

To assess the robustness of this conclusion, we simulate yield samples from a total of three different arbitrage-free affine term structure models and use those in estimations of the DNS model. These exercises also indicate that the DNS model performs well at extrapolating long bond yields from the information in bond yields of shorter maturity despite being misspecified by construction. Therefore, this evidence combined leads us to recommend using DNS models as a tool to generate extrapolated long bond yields in general.

More importantly, in the context of stress tests where regulators tend to look for events in the tails of the relevant yield distributions, we note that the bias in the extrapolated long bond yields we detect in our analysis is easily dwarfed by the changes in yield levels required to observe such outcomes. Thus, for stress test purposes, our recommendation is particularly strong.

Finally, we emphasize the flexibility of the proposed approach based on the DNS model. First, its robust estimation based on the Kalman filter handles missing data in a straightforward way and easily accommodates nonlinear measurements such as bond prices instead of the more commonly used zero-coupon bond yields. Second, the baseline model can be extended to include additional asset classes such as TIPS (see Christensen et al. 2010) and corporate bonds (see Christensen and Lopez 2012). Third, if greater flexibility is needed to fit the observed data, the extension offered by Svensson (1995) can be explored in a similar manner. In short, it is an established, well-tested, rich, and flexible, yet very robust framework that we recommend to use as the foundation for generating reliable extrapolated long bond yields to be used in stress tests and other regulations for assessing and measuring the interest rate risk of insurance companies with long-lived liabilities.  This modeling approach should readily accommodate the balance between stability of a key regulatory parameter (i.e., the UFR) and sensitivity to nearer-term economic and financial developments.  Still, we acknowledge that there are other methods for modeling, projecting, and assessing interest rate risk in the long run; see Engle et al. (2016) as well as the Smith-Wilson modeling approach adapted by EIOPA and reviewed by Gourieroux and Monfort (2015).

%\section{Why the DNS Model is not Arbitrage Free}
%
%In this section, we briefly describe the connection between the DNS model of Diebold and Li (2006)
%and the arbitrage-free Nelson-Siegel models derived in Christensen et al. (2011).
%
%
%
%The $Q$-dynamics of the arbitrage-free Nelson-Siegel models have the following form
%\begin{equation*}
%\label{eq:Q_dynamics_CV_model}
%\left(%
%\begin{array}{c}
%dL_t \\
%dS_t \\
%dC_t \end{array}%
%\right) = \left(%
%\begin{array}{ccc}
%0 & 0 & 0 \\
%0 & -\lambda & \lambda \\
%0 & 0 & -\lambda \end{array}
%\right) \left(
%\begin{array}{c}
%L_t \\
%S_t \\
%C_t \end{array} \right)dt +\Sigma \left(
%\begin{array}{c}
%dW^{L,Q}_t \\
%dW^{S,Q}_t \\
%dW^{C,Q}_t
%\end{array} \right).
%\end{equation*}
%
%Given this structure it is straightforward to demonstrate what is missing in the DNS model in order for it to be
%a theoretically consistent model structure.
%
%Assume that the constant term in the drift of $X_t$ under the
%$Q$-measure is fixed at 0, i.e. $\mu^{0,Q} = 0$. The conditional
%expectation of $X^1_t$ is found by taking expectations of
%\begin{displaymath}
% X^1_T=X^1_t+\int_t^T\Sigma_{1,\cdot}dW^Q_s,
%\end{displaymath}
%which gives
%\begin{displaymath}
% E^Q[X^1_T|\mathcal{F}_t]=X^1_t,
%\end{displaymath}
%the well-known result for a random walk.
%
%The expression for $X^2_T$ is
%\begin{displaymath}
% X^2_T =
% X^2_t-\lambda\int_t^TX^2_sds+\lambda\int_t^TX^3_sds+\int_t^T\Sigma_{2,\cdot}dW^Q_s.
%\end{displaymath}
%Taking expectations leads to
%\begin{displaymath}
% E^Q[X^2_T|\mathcal{F}_t] =
% X^2_t-\lambda\int_t^TE^Q[X^2_s|\mathcal{F}_t]ds+\lambda\int_t^TE^Q[X^3_s|\mathcal{F}_t]ds.
%\end{displaymath}
%Differentiate this w.r.t. $T$ to obtain
%\begin{displaymath}
% \frac{E^Q[X^2_T|\mathcal{F}_t]}{dT} =
% -\lambda E^Q[X^2_T|\mathcal{F}_t]+\lambda E^Q[X^3_T|\mathcal{F}_t].
%\end{displaymath}
%This means that the conditional expectation is given by the solution
%to an ordinary differential equation. However, before the ODE can be
%solved, an expression for $E^Q[X^3_T|\mathcal{F}_t]$ has to be
%found. However, it is well-established that
%\begin{displaymath}
% E^Q[X^3_T|\mathcal{F}_t]=X^3_te^{-\lambda(T-t)}.
%\end{displaymath}
%Now define $m_T=E^Q[X^2_T|\mathcal{F}_t]$, then the ODE to be solved
%is
%\begin{displaymath}
% \dot{m}_T =-\lambda m_T +\lambda X^3_te^{-\lambda(T-t)}.
%\end{displaymath}
%Since
%\begin{displaymath}
%\frac{d}{dT}\Big[m_Te^{\lambda (T-t)}\Big] =  \dot{m}_Te^{\lambda
%(T-t)} +\lambda m_Te^{\lambda (T-t)},
%\end{displaymath}
%it follows from the ODE that
%\begin{displaymath}
%\frac{d}{dT}\Big[m_Te^{\lambda (T-t)}\Big] = \lambda
%X^3_te^{-\lambda(T-t)}e^{\lambda (T-t)},
%\end{displaymath}
%which is equivalent to
%\begin{displaymath}
%\int_t^T\frac{d}{ds}\Big[m_se^{\lambda (s-t)}\Big]ds =
%\int_t^T\lambda X^3_tds.
%\end{displaymath}
%This implies that
%\begin{displaymath}
%m_Te^{\lambda (T-t)}-m_t = \lambda X^3_t(T-t),
%\end{displaymath}
%so that
%\begin{displaymath}
% E^Q[X^2_T|\mathcal{F}_t] = X^2_te^{-\lambda (T-t)}+\lambda X^3_t(T-t)e^{-\lambda
% (T-t)}.
%\end{displaymath}
%Now it is possible to integrate the conditional expectations of
%$X^1_t$ and $X^2_t$, respectively,
%\begin{displaymath}
% \int_t^T E^Q[X^1_u|\mathcal{F}_t]du = \int_t^TX^1_tdu=(T-t)X^1_t
%\end{displaymath}
%and
%\begin{eqnarray*}
% \int_t^T E^Q[X^2_u|\mathcal{F}_t]du &=& \int_t^T X^2_te^{-\lambda
% (u-t)} du + \lambda X^3_t \int_t^T (u-t)e^{-\lambda
% (u-t)}du \\
% &=& X^2_t\Big[\frac{-1}{\lambda}e^{-\lambda
% (u-t)}\Big]_t^T+ \lambda X^3_t\Big[\frac{t}{\lambda}e^{-\lambda
% (u-t)}\Big]_t^T+ \lambda X^3_t\Big[-\frac{u}{\lambda}e^{-\lambda
% (u-t)}\Big]_t^T \\
% &+& \lambda X^3_t\int_t^T\frac{1}{\lambda}e^{-\lambda
% (u-t)}du \\
% &=& \frac{1-e^{-\lambda
% (T-t)}}{\lambda}X^2_t-X^3_t t[1-e^{-\lambda
% (T-t)}] + X^3_t t- X^3_t T e^{-\lambda
% (T-t)} \\
% &+& X^3_t\Big[\frac{-1}{\lambda}e^{-\lambda
% (u-t)}\Big]_t^T \\
% &=& \frac{1-e^{-\lambda
% (T-t)}}{\lambda}X^2_t- X^3_t(T-t) e^{-\lambda
% (T-t)}+\frac{1-e^{-\lambda
% (T-t)}}{\lambda}X^3_t.
%\end{eqnarray*}
%Combining these results it holds that
%\begin{eqnarray*}
% \frac{1}{T-t}\int_t^TE^Q[r_u]du &=& \frac{1}{T-t}\int_t^T
% E^Q[X^1_u|\mathcal{F}_t]du+\frac{1}{T-t}\int_t^T
% E^Q[X^2_u|\mathcal{F}_t]du \\
% &=& X^1_t + \frac{1-e^{-\lambda
% (T-t)}}{\lambda(T-t)}X^2_t+\Big[\frac{1-e^{-\lambda
% (T-t)}}{\lambda(T-t)}-e^{-\lambda
% (T-t)}\Big]X^3_t.
%\end{eqnarray*}

\noindent {\LARGE Appendix A: The Kalman Filter Estimation of DNS Models}

\vspace{0.3cm}

%{\footnotesize

Denote the three state variables by the vector $X_t=(L_t,S_t,C_t)$,
then the state equation can be written on the following affine form
\begin{equation*}
 X_t = \Phi_0(\psi)+\Phi_1(\psi)X_{t-1}+\eta_t,\quad \eta_t\sim
 N(0,Q),
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{eqnarray*}
 \Phi_0(\psi) &=& (I-A)\mu, \\
 \Phi_1(\psi) &=& A. \\
\end{eqnarray*}
Here, $\Phi_0(\psi)$ and $\Phi_1(\psi)$ are fixed throughout the
estimation. Note that the time between observations are implicit in the equations above.

The observation equation is also affine
\begin{equation*}
 y=\Lambda X_t+\varepsilon.
\end{equation*}

Now the actual steps in the Kalman filter algorithm can be outlined.
Define the total information available at time $t$ by
\begin{equation*}
 Y_t=(y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_t),
\end{equation*}
and denote the best guess of the state variables in the last period
by $\widehat{X}_{t-1}$ and the best guess of their mean square error
matrix by $\widehat{\Sigma}_{t-1}$. In the prediction step of the
Kalman filter the best guess of the current value of $X_t$ given the
information set from the last period, $Y_{t-1}$, is calculated as
\begin{displaymath}
\widehat{X}_{t|t-1} = E^P[X_t|Y_{t-1}] = \Phi_0 +
\Phi_1\widehat{X}_{t-1}.
\end{displaymath}
The corresponding prediction for the mean square error matrix is
\begin{displaymath}
 \widehat{\Sigma}_{t|t-1} =
 \Phi_1(\psi)\widehat{\Sigma}_{t-1}\Phi_1(\psi)'+Q.
\end{displaymath}
In the update step the predicted value is improved upon by using the
additional information contained in $Y_t$. The minimum error
solution to this problem is given by the equations
\begin{eqnarray*}
 \widehat{X}_t &=& E[X_t|Y_t] = \widehat{X}_{t|t-1} +
 \widehat{\Sigma}_{t|t-1}\Lambda' F_t^{-1}v_t, \\
 \widehat{\Sigma}_t &=&
 \widehat{\Sigma}_{t|t-1}-\widehat{\Sigma}_{t|t-1}\Lambda'F_t^{-1}\Lambda\widehat{\Sigma}_{t|t-1},
 \\
\end{eqnarray*}
where\footnote{The dimension of $H_t$ is determined by the number of
bond yields observed at time $t$.}
\begin{eqnarray*}
 v_t &=& y_t-E[y_t|Y_{t-1}] = y_t -\Lambda \widehat{X}_{t|t-1}, \\
 F_t &=& cov(v_t) = \Lambda\widehat{\Sigma}_{t|t-1}\Lambda'+H_t. \\
\end{eqnarray*}
For a given set of parameters $\psi$ the logarithm of the likelihood
function is calculated as\footnote{$m_t$ is the number of observed
yields at time $t$.}
\begin{displaymath}
 \log L(y_1,\ldots,y_N;\psi) =
 \sum_{t=1}^N\Big(-\frac{m}{2}\log(2\pi)-\frac{1}{2}\log|F_t|-\frac{1}{2}v_t'F_t'v_t\Big).
\end{displaymath}
The optimal choice of the parameters $\psi$ and the corresponding
most likely path of $X_t$ are found by maximizing the value of the
log-likelihood function.

Finally, there is the important decision to make as to where to
start the Kalman filter algorithm, i.e. choosing the initial value
of the state variables. Diebold, Rudebusch, and Aruoba (2006) start
the algorithm at the unconditional mean and variance of the state
variables, which is equivalent to assuming that the state variables
are all stationary processes. The VAR(1) process for the
$X_t$-process above is stationary if the length of all the
eigenvalues of the matrix $A$ is smaller than 1, which is assumed in
the following and imposed in the Kalman filter optimization.

According to Harvey (1989) p. 120-121 the unconditional mean is
given by
\begin{displaymath}
 E{X} = \mu,
\end{displaymath}
while the unconditional variance $V$ is given implicitly as the

\noindent {\LARGE Appendix B: Simulation Study on Swiss Data}

\vspace{0.3cm}

%{\footnotesize

Still, the analysis leaves unaddressed questions about how reliable extrapolated yields derived from the DNS model are provided the observed data is generated by an arbitrage-free dynamic term structure model. From Krippner (2015), it follows that the proposed approach may work very well in theory, but in the section below, we test that conjecture more formally by simulating yield samples from three different arbitrage-free models estimated on the Swiss data analyzed in this paper. Since all three models are affine, one caveat of the simulation exercise to note up front is that the effects of nonlinearities in the yield curve are left unexplored. Although we note that, given the good fit of the DNS model, which is also affine, there is presumably little room for any significant nonlinear effects.
However, if deemed necessary, we stress that it is straightforward to include nonlinear models such as the model described in Feldh\"utter et al. (2016) in the analysis, but we leave that for future research.

In this Appendix, we first explain the steps and logic behind the simulation study we undertake.
Second, we introduce the three dynamic term structure models used to generate simulated bond yields.
Third, we describe the technical details of the model simulations before we proceed to an analysis of the results.  Why do we do this?  To show the quality of our DNS alternative even in light of misspecification.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{The General Approach}

% (preferably AFNS$_0$, AFNS$_1$-L, and AFGNS$_0$ models)
First, we simulate arbitrage-free dynamic term structure models and generate zero-coupon yields with maturities $\tau$ up to 50 years, $\tau\in\{0.25,0.5,1,2,3,5,7,10,15,20,30,50\}$.
We stress that the parameters used in the simulations are obtained from model estimations based on the Swiss bond price data with maturities up to 50 years.

Second, we use the simulated samples as input into DNS model estimations with varying maximum yield maturity: 10 years, 20 years, and 30 years, respectively.
For comparison we also make corresponding estimations of the true model that generated the data.

Finally, we calculate the extrapolation errors from the DNS model estimations and compare them to the extrapolation errors made by the true model.
This should provide a fair assessment of the ability of the DNS model to extrapolate long bond yields as a misspecified representation of the actual
yield dynamics.
%To be specific, we focus on the extrapolation error relative to the true model estimated with all data. This means that we first estimate the true model on the simulated data using all yields. Second, we estimate the true model and the DNS model on the simulated data, but only with yields up to a maximum maturity of $\tau_{max}\in\{10,20,30\}$. Finally, the extrapolation error is compared to the fitted error of the true model estimated with all data, which is as close as one can practically get to the true yield that is not observed by the econometrician.

\textbf{Three AFNS Models for simulation}
%\label{subsec:simulated_models}

In this section, we briefly describe the three arbitrage-free affine dynamic term structure models we use in the simulation study.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{The CV Model}
%\label{subsubsec:CV_model}

We first focus on the arbitrage-free equivalent of the DNS model known as the arbitrage-free class of Nelson-Siegel (AFNS) models, which is introduced in Christensen et al. (2011). Since this model is characterized by constant volatility, we refer to it as the CV model.
In this class of models, the state vector is denoted by $X_t=(L_t,S_t,C_t)$, where $L_t$ is a level factor,
$S_t$ is a slope factor, and $C_t$ is a curvature factor. The instantaneous risk-free rate is defined as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:risk_free_rate}
r_t = L_t+S_t.
\end{equation}
To preserve the Nelson and Siegel (1987) factor loading structure in the yield function, the risk-neutral (or $Q$-) dynamics
of the state variables are given by the stochastic differential equations\footnote{As discussed in Christensen et al. (2011),
with a unit root in the level factor, the model is not arbitrage-free with an unbounded horizon; therefore, as is often done in
theoretical discussions, we impose an arbitrary maximum horizon.}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Q_dynamics_CV_model}
\left(%
\begin{array}{c}
dL_t \\
dS_t \\
dC_t \end{array}%
\right) = \left(%
\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -\lambda & \lambda \\
0 & 0 & -\lambda \end{array}
\right) \left(
\begin{array}{c}
L_t \\
S_t \\
C_t \end{array} \right)dt +\Sigma \left(
\begin{array}{c}
dW^{L,Q}_t \\
dW^{S,Q}_t \\
dW^{C,Q}_t
\end{array} \right),
\end{equation}
where $\Sigma$ is the constant covariance (or volatility) matrix.\footnote{As per Christensen et al. (2011),
$\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix, and $\theta^Q$ is set to zero without loss of generality.}
Based on this specification of the $Q$-dynamics, zero-coupon bond yields preserve the Nelson-Siegel factor loading structure as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:yield_CV_model}
y_t(\tau) = L_t+\left(\frac{1-e^{-\lambda\tau}}{\lambda\tau}%
\right)S_t+\left(\frac{1-e^{-\lambda\tau}}{\lambda\tau} -e^{-\lambda\tau}%
\right)C_t-\frac{A(\tau)}{\tau},
\end{equation}
where the yield-adjustment term is given by
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{A(\tau)}{\tau}
 &=&  \frac{\sigma_{11}^2}{6}\tau^2 + \sigma^2_{22}
\Big[\frac{1}{2\lambda^2}-\frac{1}{\lambda^3}\frac{1-e^{-\lambda\tau}}{\tau}+\frac{1}{4\lambda^3} \frac{1-e^{-2\lambda\tau}}{\tau}\Big] \\
% Third integral
&&
+\sigma^2_{33}\Big[\frac{1}{2\lambda^2}
 +\frac{1}{\lambda^2}e^{-\lambda\tau}
 -\frac{1}{4\lambda}\tau e^{-2\lambda\tau}
 -\frac{3}{4\lambda^2}e^{-2\lambda\tau} +\frac{5}{8\lambda^3}\frac{1-e^{-2\lambda\tau}}{\tau}
-\frac{2}{\lambda^3}\frac{1-e^{-\lambda\tau}}{\tau}\Big].
\end{eqnarray*}

%Thus, the zero-coupon bond price function used to calculate the net present value of the cash flow of coupon bonds is given by
%\begin{equation}
% \label{eq:zero_coupon_bond_price_yield_AFNS_model}
% P_(\tau) = \exp\big(-y_t(\tau)\tau\big).
%\end{equation}

%\subsection{Market Prices of Risk}

So far, the description of the CV model has relied solely on the dynamics of the state variables under the $Q$-measure used for pricing.
However, to complete the description of the model and to implement it empirically, we will need to specify the risk premiums that connect the factor dynamics under the $Q$-measure to the dynamics under the real-world (or historical) $P$-measure. It is important to note that there are no restrictions on the dynamic drift components under the empirical $P$-measure beyond the requirement of constant volatility.
To facilitate empirical implementation, we use the essentially affine risk premium specification introduced in Duffee (2002). In the Gaussian framework,
this specification implies that the risk premiums $\Gamma_t$ depend on the state variables; that is,
\begin{equation*}
 \Gamma_t=\gamma^0+\gamma^1X_t,
\end{equation*}
where $\gamma^{0}\in\mathbf{R}^3$ and $\gamma^{1}\in\mathbf{R}^{3\times3}$ contain unrestricted parameters.
%
%
%\subsection{The Objective Model Dynamics}
%
%To complete the model, we define the price of risk, which links the risk-neutral and real-world yield dynamics.
%Using the essentially affine risk premium specification introduced in Duffee (2002), the implied measure change is given by
%\begin{equation*}
%dW^Q_t = dW^P_t + \Gamma_tdt,
%\end{equation*}
%where $\Gamma_t = \gamma^{0}+\gamma^{1}X_t,$ $\gamma^{0}\in\mathbf{R}^5$, and $\gamma^{1}\in\mathbf{R}^{5\times5}$.
Thus, the resulting unrestricted three-factor CV model has $P$-dynamics given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:P_dynamics_CV_model}
\left(%
\begin{array}{c}
dL_t \\
dS_t \\
dC_t  \end{array}
\right) = \left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\kappa^{P}_{11} & \kappa^{P}_{12} & \kappa^{P}_{13} \\
\kappa^{P}_{21} & \kappa^{P}_{22} & \kappa^{P}_{23} \\
\kappa^{P}_{31} & \kappa^{P}_{32} & \kappa^{P}_{33} \end{array}
\right) \left(\left(
\begin{array}{c}
\theta^{P}_1 \\
\theta^{P}_2 \\
\theta^{P}_3 \end{array} \right)- \left(
\begin{array}{c}
L_t \\
S_t \\
C_t \end{array}
\right)\right)dt +\Sigma \left(
\begin{array}{c}
dW^{L,P}_t \\
dW^{S,P}_t \\
dW^{C,P}_t
\end{array}
\right).
\end{equation}
This is the transition equation in the Kalman filter estimation.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{The SV Model}
%\label{subsubsec:SV_model}

Financial time series, such as interest rates and bond yields, have been shown
to have time-varying volatility, which is a feature not often incorporated into
arbitrage-free term structure models; see Andersen and Benzoni (2010) for further discussion.
To address this concern, Christensen et al. (2014) develop a general class of
AFNS models that incorporate spanned stochastic volatility.  To distinguish
between the various types of models, we use the notation outlined in Dai and Singleton (2000)
for classifying affine term structure models, such that the CV model is within
the $A_0(3)$ class of models that do not have volatility dynamics.
As detailed in Christensen et al. (2014), there are several possible volatility
specifications within their three-factor framework.

For our analysis, we choose an $A_1(3)$ volatility specification that incorporates stochastic volatility based on the level factor.
%\footnote{In Appendix D,we summarize results for all five admissible extensions of the CV model with one, two, or three spanned stochastic volatility factors (i.e., $A_1(3)$, $A_2(3)$, and $A_3(3)$ models). Note that the results for these alternative models are qualitatively similar, although quantitatively worse than the $A_1(3)$ specification we focus on here.}
%This choice was motivated by a desire to focus on the longer maturity TIPS yields, since observable proxies for the value of the TIPS deflation protection option are most available near the five-year maturity point.
For this stochastic volatility (SV) model, the state vector and instantaneous risk-free rates are the same as before.
To preserve the Nelson-Siegel factor loading structure and impose our volatility specification,
the $Q$-dynamics of the state variables are given by
%\footnote{While the modeling framework allows for the two level factors to directly affect the volatility of the common slope and curvature factors, we fix the associated volatility sensitivity parameters to zero as in Christensen et al. (2014a), who report that these volatility sensitivity parameters are typically insignificant for U.S. Treasury data.  This choice leads to analytical bond pricing formulas that greatly facilitate model estimation and analysis.}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Q_dynamics_SV_model}
\hspace{-4.1cm}
\left(\begin{array}{c}
dL_t \\
dS_t \\
dC_t \end{array}
\right) = \left(%
\begin{array}{ccc}
\kappa^Q_{L} & 0 & 0  \\
0 & \lambda & -\lambda  \\
0 & 0 & \lambda \end{array}%
\right) \left[\left(\begin{array}{c}
\theta^Q_{L} \\
0 \\
0
\end{array}\right)-\left(
\begin{array}{c}
L_t \\
S_t \\
C_t
\end{array}
\right)\right]dt
\end{equation}
\begin{equation*}
\hspace{2.25cm}
+ \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
 \sigma_{11} & 0 & 0  \\
 \sigma_{21} & \sigma_{22} & 0  \\
 \sigma_{31} & \sigma_{32} & \sigma_{33} \end{array}\right) \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
 \sqrt{L_t} & 0 & 0  \\
 0 & \sqrt{1+\beta_{21}L_t} & 0  \\
 0 & 0 & \sqrt{1+\beta_{31}L_t} \end{array}\right)\left(
\begin{array}{c}
dW^{L,Q}_t \\
dW^{S,Q}_t \\
dW^{C,Q}_t \end{array}%
\right).
\end{equation*}


The representation of the zero-coupon bond yield function becomes\footnote{In our implementation, we fix $\kappa^Q_{L}$ = $10^{-6}$
to get a close approximation to the uniform level factor loading in the CV model.}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:yield_SV_model}
 y_t(\tau) = g\Big(\kappa^Q_{L}\Big)L_t  + \left(\frac{1-e^{-\lambda\tau}}{\lambda\tau}\right) S_t
 +\left(\frac{1-e^{-\lambda\tau}}{\lambda\tau}-e^{-\lambda\tau}\right)C_t-\frac{A\big(\tau;\kappa^Q_{L}\big)}{\tau},
\end{equation}
where $g^N\Big(\kappa^Q_{L}\Big)$ is a modified loading on the level factor.
Note that the slope and the curvature factor preserve their Nelson-Siegel factor loadings exactly, although the structure of the yield-adjustment term $A\big(\tau; \kappa^Q_{L}\big)/\tau$ is different than before.\footnote{Note that both $g\Big(\kappa^Q_{L}\Big)$ and $A\big(\tau; \kappa^Q_{L}\big)$ must be calculated numerically by solving a system of ODEs, see Christensen et al. (2014) for details.}

To link the risk-neutral and real-world dynamics of the state variables,
we here use the extended affine risk premium specification introduced
by Cheridito et al. (2007), as per Christensen et al. (2014). The maximally flexible affine
specification of the $P$-dynamics is thus
%\footnote{The specification given by equations (\ref{eq:risk_free_rate}), (\ref{eq:Q_dynamics_SV_model}), and (\ref{eq:P_dynamics_SV_model}) has 3 restrictions relative to its canonical $A_1(3)$ model.}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:P_dynamics_SV_model}
\hspace{-3.75cm}
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
dL_t \\
dS_t \\
dC_t \end{array}
\right) =
   \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
    \kappa^P_{11} & 0 & 0  \\
    \kappa^P_{21} & \kappa^P_{22} & \kappa^P_{23} \\
    \kappa^P_{31} & \kappa^P_{32} & \kappa^P_{33} \end{array} \right)
  \left[ \left(\begin{array}{c}
  \theta^P_1 \\
  \theta^P_2 \\
  \theta^P_3 \end{array}\right)-\left(
\begin{array}{c}
L_t \\
S_t \\
C_t \end{array}
\right)\right]dt
\end{equation}
\begin{equation*}
\hspace{2.25cm}
 + \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
    \sigma_{11} & 0 & 0  \\
    \sigma_{21} & \sigma_{22} & 0  \\
    \sigma_{31} & \sigma_{32} & \sigma_{33} \end{array} \right)
     \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
 \sqrt{L_t} & 0 & 0  \\
 0 & \sqrt{1+\beta_{21}L_t} & 0  \\
 0 & 0 & \sqrt{1+\beta_{31}L_t} \end{array}\right) \left(
\begin{array}{c}
dW^{L,P}_t \\
dW^{S,P}_t \\
dW^{C,P}_t \end{array}%
\right).
\end{equation*}

To keep the model arbitrage-free, the level factor must be
prevented from hitting the lower zero-boundary. This positivity
requirement is ensured by imposing the Feller conditions under
both probability measures, which in this case are two; that is,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Feller_conditions_SV_model}
 \kappa^P_{11}\theta^P_1  > \frac{1}{2}\sigma_{11}^2 \quad \text{and} \quad 10^{-6}\cdot\theta^Q_{L} > \frac{1}{2}\sigma_{11}^2.
\end{equation}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{The GCV Model}
%\label{subsubsec:GCV_model}

The main in-sample problem with the regular Nelson-Siegel model is
that, for reasonable choices of $\lambda$ (which are empirically in
the vicinity of 0.5 for U.S. Treasury yield data), the factor
loading for the slope and the curvature factor decay rapidly to zero
as a function of maturity. Thus, the model mostly relies on the level factor
for its fit to yields with ten years or more to maturity. Empirically,
this limitation shows up as a lack of fit of the long-term yields, as described in Christensen et al. (2011).

For this reason we also consider a generalized AFNS model introduced in Christensen et al. (2009) that includes an additional slope and curvature factor.
Since this model is also characterized by constant volatility and represents a generalization of the CV model, we refer to it as the GCV model.

In this class of models, the vector of state variables is $X_t=(L_t,S^1_t,S^2_t,C^1_t,C^2_t)$, while the instantaneous risk-free rate is defined by
\begin{equation*}
 r_{t} = L_t + S^1_t + S^2_t.
\end{equation*}
To generate the appropriate Nelson and Siegel (1987) factor loading structure in the yield function,
the risk-neutral (or $Q$-) dynamics of the state variables are given by the stochastic differential equations

\vspace{-0.3cm} {\small
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Q_dynamics_GCV_model}
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
dL_t \\
dS^1_t \\
dS^2_t \\
dC^1_t \\
dC^2_t \end{array}\right) =\left(
\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & -\lambda_1 & 0 & \lambda_1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -\lambda_2 & 0 & \lambda_2 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & -\lambda_1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -\lambda_2 \end{array} \right)\left(
\begin{array}{c}
L_t \\
S^1_t \\
S^2_t \\
C^1_t \\
C^2_t  \end{array} \right) dt+\Sigma \left(
\begin{array}{c}
dW_{t}^{L,Q} \\
dW_{t}^{S^1,Q} \\
dW_{t}^{S^2,Q} \\
dW_{t}^{C^1,Q} \\
dW_{t}^{C^2,Q}\end{array} \right) ,\quad \lambda_1 > \lambda_2 >0,
\end{equation}}

\vspace{-0.3cm} \noindent where we continue to assume that $\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix.

In this model, zero-coupon bond yields are given by

\vspace{-0.3cm} {\footnotesize
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:yield_GCV_model}
y_t(\tau) = L_t+\frac{1-e^{-\lambda_1\tau}}{\lambda_1\tau}S^1_t+\frac{1-e^{-\lambda_2\tau}}{\lambda_2\tau}S^2_t
 +\Big[\frac{1-e^{-\lambda_1\tau}}{\lambda_1\tau}-e^{-\lambda_1\tau}\Big]C^1_t
 +\Big[\frac{1-e^{-\lambda_2\tau}}{\lambda_2\tau}-e^{-\lambda_2\tau}\Big]C^2_t - \frac{A^G(\tau)}{\tau},
\end{equation}}

\vspace{-0.3cm} \noindent where $\frac{A^G(\tau)}{\tau}$ represents a generalized yield-adjustment, see Christensen et al. (2009) for details.


Similar to the CV model, the description of the GCV model is completed by specifying the risk premiums that connect the factor dynamics under the $Q$-measure to the dynamics under the real-world (or historical) $P$-measure.
To facilitate empirical implementation, we continue to use the essentially affine risk premium specification introduced in Duffee (2002).
In the Gaussian framework, this specification implies that the risk premiums $\Gamma_t$ take the following form
\begin{equation*}
 \Gamma_t=\gamma^0+\gamma^1X_t,
\end{equation*}
where $\gamma^{0}\in\mathbf{R}^5$ and $\gamma^{1}\in\mathbf{R}^{5\times5}$ contain unrestricted parameters.

Thus, the resulting unrestricted five-factor GCV model has $P$-dynamics given by

\vspace{-0.3cm} {\small
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:P_dynamics_GCV_model}
\left(%
\begin{array}{c}

{\small The table shows the estimated parameters of the $K^{P}$ matrix, $\theta^{P}$ vector, and diagonal $\Sigma$ matrix for the GCV model with independent factors. The estimated value of $\lambda_1$ is 2.5507 (0.0629), while the estimated value of $\lambda_2$ is 0.1648 (0.0037). The maximum log likelihood value is 31,710.10. The numbers in parentheses are the estimated parameter standard deviations.}}
 \label{tab:est_parameters_GCV_model}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:est_parameters_GCV_model} reports the estimated parameters for the GCV model.
We note that the estimated values of $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are above and below, respectively, the values obtained for the CV and SV models.
This means that the first pair of slope and curvature factors is used to fit the short end of the yield curve, while
the second pair is used to improve the fit of medium- and longer-term yields.
Furthermore, the level factor remains very persistent and with dynamic properties similar
to those observed in the other two models.

\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:summary_statistics_fitted_yield_errors_various_models} contains the summary statistics for
the fitted errors of the three arbitrage-free models used in the simulation exercise with a comparison
to the fit obtained with the DNS model.
First, we note that the DNS, CV, and SV models all give a very similar fit to the data across the entire cross section of bond prices.
Most surprisingly, this also holds for the two 50-year bonds. Thus, the arbitrage-free models are not able to
exploit the additional yield-adjustment term in their discount functions to improve the fit of long-term bond prices.
This is also consistent with the findings reported by Christensen et al. (2011).

Second, it is not a surprise that the GCV model with its five state variables is able to outperform the other models
at fitting the entire cross section of bond prices, which is similar to the results reported in Christensen et al. (2009).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{Details of the Simulations}

To keep things simple, the simulation exercise is centered around the independent-factors specification of each model described in the previous section.
Thus, it is these specifications and their estimated parameters reported in Tables \ref{tab:est_parameters_CV_model} to \ref{tab:est_parameters_GCV_model}
that we use in the simulations.

Based on those estimated parameters for each model, we first simulate $N=$ 100 sample paths for the state variables observed at a monthly frequency for ten years. In a second step, these simulated factor paths are converted into standard zero-coupon yields for the CV, SV, and GCV models
using equations (\ref{eq:yield_CV_model}), (\ref{eq:yield_SV_model}), and (\ref{eq:yield_GCV_model}), respectively.
The simulated yield samples contain zero-coupon yields with a total of 12 maturities: 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 50 years.
A Gaussian \textit{i.i.d.} measurement error with zero mean and a standard deviation $\sigma_\varepsilon$ of 10 basis points is added to each simulated yield.
Note that, to make the exercises across models as comparable as possible, it is the same set of simulated Gaussian \textit{i.i.d.} measurement errors that is used in each type of simulated yield data independent of the simulated model.
Since the measurement equation for zero-coupon yields within the three model classes and the DNS model is affine, it follows that
the model estimations based on the simulated yield samples can be performed with the standard Kalman filter
unlike the estimations based on the actual bond price data that require nonlinear filtering.


We now turn to the details of the simulation of the factor paths.
The continuous-time $P$-dynamics in affine models are, in general, given by
\begin{equation*}
 dX_t = K^P(\theta^P-X_t)dt+\Sigma D(X_t)dW^P_t.
\end{equation*}
For both restricted square-root processes and unconstrained processes the continuous-time dynamics can be approximated using the Euler approximation.\footnote{Thompson (2008) is an example.}
To exemplify, for a restricted square-root process,
\begin{equation*}
 dX^i_t =
 \kappa^P_{ii}(\theta^P_i-X^i_t)dt+\kappa^P_{ij}(\theta^P_j-X^j_t)dt
 +\sigma_{ii}\sqrt{X^i_t}dW^{P,i}_t,
\end{equation*}
the algorithm is
\begin{equation*}
 X^i_t = X^i_{t-1} +\kappa^P_{ii}(\theta^P_i-X^i_{t-1})\Delta t +\kappa^P_{ij}(\theta^P_j-X^j_{t-1})\Delta t+
 \sigma_{ii}\sqrt{X^i_{t-1}}\sqrt{\Delta t}z^i_t, \quad z^i_t \sim
 N(0,1).
\end{equation*}
We fix $\Delta t$ at a uniform value of 0.0001 to get a close approximation to the true factor dynamics.
In the SV model, Feller conditions are imposed in the model estimations, which ensures that its parameter set used in the simulations satisfy all nonnegativity
requirements, so the ``true'' underlying continuous-time process never becomes negative $P$-a.s.
However, for the discretely observed process above, there is always a positive, but usually very small probability that the approximation will become negative.
Whenever this happens, we truncate the simulated square-root processes at zero similar to what we do in the estimation of the SV model.

As for the starting point of the simulation algorithm, $X_0$, we could draw that from the unconditional joint distribution of the state variables
in the CV and GCV models thanks to their Gaussian dynamics. However, for the SV model and for affine models in general, we do not know the unconditional distribution of the state variables. Therefore, to keep our approach amenable to affine and non-affine models in general, we take the estimated value of the state variables at the end of the Swiss bond price sample and simulate them according to the algorithm above for 100 years. This effectively gives us random draws from the joint unconditional distribution of $X_t$.

Now, we use the $N$ simulated samples of zero-coupon yields as input into a corresponding number of Kalman filter estimations.
In each case, we use the true parameters as the starting point for each optimization.
Since we are estimating the true model using the true parameters as the starting point for each optimization,
this provides us with a clean read of the properties of the standard Kalman filter as an estimator, not impacted by any errors related to model misspecification.

In the final step, we use the $N$ simulated samples of zero-coupon yields as input into a corresponding number of Kalman filter estimations
based on the DNS model, which is misspecified by construction. However, by comparing the results to those obtained from estimations of the true model that generated the data we get a very direct read of the potential bias involved in using the DNS model for yield extrapolations subject to various types of model misspecifications. First, by comparing to the CV model results, we can assess whether it matters to enforce theoretical consistency in the form of absence of arbitrage.
Second, when we compare to the SV model results, we can further assess to what extent it matters to account for stochastic volatility in yields.
Finally, the comparison to the GCV model results can speak to the importance of having the correct number of state variables.

      \label{fig:mean_extrapolation_error_50yr_yield_DNS_model_vs_CV_model}
\end{figure}

To begin, we analyze the results we get from the $N$ samples simulated based on the CV model.
For each sample we perform three estimations, one based on the CV model using all 12 yields, one based on the CV model using only yields with maturities up to $\tau_{max}$, and
one based on the DNS model using only yields with maturities up to $\tau_{max}$.

In Figure \ref{fig:mean_extrapolation_error_50yr_yield_DNS_model_vs_CV_model}, each panel shows the mean fitted error of the 50-year yield from the three model estimations for all $N$ samples.
First, we focus on the black lines, which are identical in all three panels and show the mean fitted errors for the 50-year yield when that yield is included in the model estimations.
It is practically zero in all simulations, which shows that the CV model has no difficulty in fitting the 50-year yields in sample.
Second, we note that when the maximum maturity used in the CV model estimation is reduced, the mean extrapolation error of the 50-year yields can fluctuate
notably across samples as indicated by the variation in the solid blue lines.
Still, it is the case that the fluctuations happen around the zero-line, so in expectation the mean fitted error is close to zero.
Finally, it is noted that the mean fitted errors of the 50-year yield from the DNS model are downward biased, and more so the shorter
the maximum yield maturity used in the model estimation, that is, the fitted 50-year yields implied by the DNS model are systematically above the simulated 50-year yields.
This bias arises thanks to the shape of the yield-adjustment term $\frac{A(\tau)}{\tau}$ in the CV model,
which becomes increasingly negative as the maturity goes to infinity.
Since the DNS model does not contain such a term, its extrapolated 50-year yield is essentially a flat extrapolation of the estimated value of the level factor,
which is anchored near the level of the longest observed yield maturity.
As a consequence, the fitted 50-year yield from the DNS model will naturally embed the effect from the yield-adjustment term
when the maximum maturity of the observed yields approaches 50 years. This drives the bias towards zero as the longest yield maturity included in the model estimation approaches 50 years.

In terms of magnitude, the average of the mean extrapolation error of the fitted 50-year yields across the $N$ simulations is -0.39\%, -0.30\%, and -0.24\%, when the maximum yield maturity used in the model estimation is 10 years, 20 years, and 30 years, respectively.
Once this bias is compared with the general variation in yield levels, which is orders of magnitude larger as we demonstrate in Section \ref{sec:US_Treasury_analysis} in the context of U.S. Treasury yields, it follows that the DNS model generates what must be considered reliable extrapolated 50-year yields, even if only yields with at most ten years to maturity are used in the model estimation.

      \label{fig:mean_extrapolation_error_50yr_yield_DNS_model_vs_SV_model}
\end{figure}


In this section, we analyze the results we get with the simulated samples from the SV model.
As in the previous section, we perform three estimations for each sample, one based on the SV model using all 12 yields, one based on the SV model using only yields with maturities up to a given $\tau_{max}$, and one based on the DNS model using only yields with maturities up to the same given $\tau_{max}$.

In Figure \ref{fig:mean_extrapolation_error_50yr_yield_DNS_model_vs_SV_model}, each panel shows the mean fitted error of the 50-year yield from the three model estimations for all $N$ samples. In this case, it is striking that there is practically no bias in the extrapolated 50-year yields from the DNS model.
The average of the mean fitted 50-year yield extrapolation errors are -0.04\%, -0.03\%, and -0.03\%, when the maximum yield maturity used in the model estimation is 10 years, 20 years, and 30 years, respectively.
Thus, if the SV model happens to be the true model generating the yields we observe, relying on the DNS model for the calculation of
extrapolated 50-year yields would imply almost no bias on average, even if only 10-year yields are used in the model estimation.
This reinforces the results we got from the simulated yield samples based on the CV model.

%In terms of magnitude, the average of the mean extrapolation error of the fitted 50-year yields across the $N$ estimations is ???\%, -0.01\%, and -0.03\%, when the maximum yield maturity used in the model estimation is 10 years, 20 years, and 30 years, respectively.

      \label{fig:mean_extrapolation_error_50yr_yield_DNS_model_vs_GCV_model}
\end{figure}

In this section, we analyze the results we get from the samples simulated based on the estimated GCV model.
As in the previous section, we perform three estimations for each sample, one based on the GCV model using all 12 yields, one based on the GCV model using only yields with maturities up to a given $\tau_{max}$, and one based on the DNS model using only yields with maturities up to the same given $\tau_{max}$.

In Figure \ref{fig:mean_extrapolation_error_50yr_yield_DNS_model_vs_GCV_model}, each panel shows the mean fitted error of the 50-year yield from the three model estimations for all $N$ samples.
With both 20 years and 30 years as the maximum maturity there is only modest bias in the 50-year yields extrapolated from the DNS model.
Furthermore, they are only slightly larger and more volatile than the extrapolation errors observed for the true model.
It is only if we limit the sample to yields with at most 10 years to maturity
that the extrapolation errors start to be erratic.
Thus, we take these results to imply that the DNS model is also able to generate reliable extrapolated
long-term yields if the GCV model happens to be the model that generates the yields we observe.

In terms of magnitude, the average of the mean extrapolation error of the fitted 50-year yields across the $N$ simulated samples is 0.34\%, -0.06\%, and -0.13\%, when the maximum yield maturity used in the model estimation is 10 years, 20 years, and 30 years, respectively.


%In this case, it is striking that there is practically no bias in the extrapolated 50-year yields from the DNS model. The average of the mean fitted 50-year yield extrapolation errors are -0.07\%, -0.05\%, and -0.04\%, when the maximum yield maturity used in the model estimation is 10 years, 20 years, and 30 years, respectively.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\textbf{Summary}

To summarize the results from the simulation study, we find that under realistic conditions where the DNS model is
estimated with yields with maturities up to 30 years, it is able to produce extrapolated long bond yields with only a small bias, and this holds for all three arbitrage-free affine dynamic term structure models considered.
Furthermore, even if only bonds of shorter maturity than thirty years are available, the DNS model will still produce extrapolated long bond yields with little bias in most cases.
