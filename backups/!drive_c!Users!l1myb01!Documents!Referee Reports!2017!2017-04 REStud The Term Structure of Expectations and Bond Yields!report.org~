* Summary

The paper fits a state space model to survey expectations of
inflation, nominal rates, and output growth. The model features
shifting endpoints which are related through a long-run Fisher
equation. The data include surveys from various sources, and for a
number of different horizons. The model is able to fit these survey
expectations well. The paper then proceeds to calculate the term
premium in long-term interest rates by substracting the average
expected short rate implied by the model from observed yields. It
turns out that this term premium explains most of the variation in
interest rates, including the covariation of interest rates at
different maturities. The paper contains additional analysis of the
relationship between this estimated term premium and macro forecasts
as well as structural macroeconomic shocks.

* Evaluation

The paper addresses one of the central issues of the term structure
literature of the last several decades: What is the role of
expectations and risk premia for the evolution and dynamics of
long-term interest rates? The approach that the authors have chosen to
answer this question, however, appears to take a step backward from
the advances accomplished in this literature. Expectations are
taken exclusively from surveys without any information from yields,
and the links between expectations and asset prices that modern
finance theory requires for absence of arbitrage are completely
ignored. This stands in contrast to the promising and often successful
efforts taken in the no-arbitrage term structure literature to combine the information in
long-term yields with the information in surveys to understand the
expectations of investors. Instead, the model presented in the paper
is only a slight extension of existing models, like those proposed by Kozicki and
Tinsley (2012) and Aruoba (2016), that are essentially methods to
obtain a smooth path of expectations from surveys that contain missing
observations and irregular horizons. In light of these points, the
methodological contribution of the paper is only modest.

What can we learn about macro-finance interactions and the term
structure of interest rates using this model? The key finding of the
paper is that the survey-based estimates of expectations actually
explain very little of the variation in long-term interest rates. The
authors interpret this finding as demonstrating the important role of
the term premium. While that is one possible interpretation, the other
way to phrase the result of the paper is that survey expectations are simply unsuccessful to
explain variation in asset prices. But that is a result that we have
known for a very long time, going all the way back to Shiller's results on excess
volatility from the 1970s and 1980s. Fundamentals, and expectations of
fundamentals, can only explain a small share of movements in asset
prices, and it is well-known that this is true for long-term interest
rates as well. The empirical results of the paper are perfectly in
line with this conventional wisdom. The term premium is a residual
from a model that does not do a good job to explain long-term yields,
hence it captures most of the variation in these yields, including of
course the pronounced comovements of yields across maturity. (As an
aside, this has very little to do with Cochrane-Piazzesi's results as
claimed by the authors, since Cochrane-Piazzesi documented the
surprising and controversial fact that the /same/ linear combination of yields predicts
bond returns for different maturities.)

For these reasons I think that the paper in its current shape and
form is making very little headway for the term structure
literature and macro-finance, both in terms of methodology and
empirical results. However, I still think the paper has potential, and
in the following I make some suggestions that I believe would improve
the paper:

- The contribution is to model survey expectations of macro variables
  and yields, but there is essentially no model validation other than
  some notion that the model fits the surveys well. I encourage the
  authors to challenge the model more and demonstrate its
  usefulness. One idea is to test the restrictions that are imposed by
  the Fisher equation. Another is to use the model for forecasting the
  macro variables under consideration. Furthermore, the trends that
  are extracted from the data may be compared to alternative estimates
  of these trends, to assess their plausibility (e.g., the CBO's
  estimate of potential GDP growth), i.e., to see whether the filtered
  trends make economic sense.

- The model could be used to provide some measures of uncertainty
  around the estimated expectation paths (and estimated term
  premia). Most readers would expect more discussion of disagreement
  vs.~subjective uncertainty, as well as estimation/parameter
  uncertainty underlying the model. Currently the paper almost
  exclusively provides point estimates of the objects of interests,
  and essentially ignores uncertainty.

- The paper estimates subjective risk premia, in contrast to objective
  risk premia that would be obtained from statistical models of
  expectations. Piazzesi, Salomao and Schneider (2015) provide an
  in-depth comparison of these risk premia and provide an economic
  explanation of the differences (they find the same result as the
  present paper, that subjective risk premia are not very volatile). I
  recommend that the authors put their findings into this perspective,
  and consider bringing objective risk premia into the picture and
  discussion.

- The authors should argue much more convincingly why they ignore
  yields in their estimation of the expectations component, in
  contrast to a large body of work that has found ways to incorporate
  both surveys and asset prices to accomplish this task.
