\maketitle
\begin{itemize}
\item Welcome, invite questions along the way
\item Summary: economy overall is at "equilibrium" meaning it's close to
its long-run trend path
\begin{itemize}
\item economy has "fully recovered" (JW)
\item I will drill down on the topic of long-run trends, how they
feature in our forecast, how we use them to separate the signal
from the noise
\end{itemize}
\item GDP: output continues to grow at a healthy pace
\begin{itemize}
\item low Q1 number was an outlier due to transitory/one-off factors
\item Q1 was, as we expected, revised up from 0.5 to 1.2\% (at annual
pace). Improved from initial estimate but still a low number.
\item Q1 low because: Seasonality (seasonal downward bias), weather, low inventory
investment, temporarily low consumer spending
\begin{itemize}
\item path act: delayed reimbursement of taxes for low-income
households
\end{itemize}
\item expect bounceback in Q2, growth around 3\%, mainly due to
\begin{itemize}
\item consumer spending
\item inventory investment
\end{itemize}
\item recent data on spending and production suggests continued strong
momentum, strong fundamentals in Q2
\begin{itemize}
\item \uline{hard data:} retail sales strong; industrial production 1\%, strong
(manufacturing improved over last few months); capacity
utilization rose in April (although slightly below long-run
average, indicates some slack); CAPEX indicators solid; CFNAI up
to positive, reflecting mostly production-related
indicators. suggests that growth in economic activity is
somewhat above its trend
\item \uline{soft data:} conference board consumer confidence declined
slightly but still highest since Dec. 2003; ISM index consistent
with expansion
\end{itemize}
\item consumer spending bolstered by
\begin{itemize}
\item ongoing job gains
\item rising household incomes and wealth -- strong equity market
\item buoyant consumer sentiment - remains high both within this cycle
and in broader historical context
\end{itemize}
\item overall expect 2017 GDP growth near 2 percent
\item compares to g* = 1.5\%
\item suggests economy is growing somewhat faster than trend
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\newpage
\begin{itemize}
\item labor market continues to improve
\begin{itemize}
\item payroll growth continues at robust if somewhat slower pace
\begin{itemize}
\item confirmed that low March was a hiccup
\item May below expectations and April revised down
\item but both still substantially above the "breakeven rate" that is
needed to keep unmployment stable (80-100k), as is the 6-month
average
\end{itemize}
\item indications that pace has slowed because it's harder to fill vacancies
\begin{itemize}
\item 6 million job openings in April, record high
\end{itemize}
\item UR fell 0.4pp since end of last year
\begin{itemize}
\item now lowest since May 2001
\item UR four tenths below the FOMC's median estimate of u*. Most
participants are between 4.75 and 5\%
\item and below our own estimate (u* = 4.8\%)
\end{itemize}
\item same story from various labor market indicators
\begin{itemize}
\item consumer sentiment about labor market conditions
\item participation rate is low but that's because of structural
reasons -- demographics, disability insurance, skills mismatch,
lack of mobility. Participation has remained stable for quite a
while and is close to its trend level. Don't
expect significant increase in participation
\item measures of underutilization close to pre-recession lows - U6, IPT
\item (involuntary part time slightly elevated but that's
because employers now rely more on part time -- structural change)
\end{itemize}
\item wage growth heating up as slack declines (source GS 5/16)
\begin{itemize}
\item wage growth had been missing from this recovery
\item but now wage acceleration is underway
\item compensation per hour; average hourly earnings 2.5\%, which isn't
particularly fast but better than what we have seen over most of
this recovery; not as fast as before the crisis because of slow
productivity growth
\item various wage trackers (Atlanta Fed, GS) show faster speed
\item expect wage growth to further accelerate
\end{itemize}
\item in sum, the data is consistent with ongoing tightening and a labor
market that is at or beyond full employment
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\newpage
\begin{itemize}
\item inflation close to 2\% target and expected to reach it soon
\begin{itemize}
\item in February PCE inflation briefly surpassed the FOMC's 2\% target
\item but recently some downside surprises -- inflation remains somewhat
stubborn -- slowdown in core inflation
\item \textbf{headline PCE} in April was year-over-year 1.7\%
\item \textbf{core PCE} was 0.2\% in April, which was a solid print, but
year-over-year is only 1.5\% -- we think this is a low point
\item in our view this slight weakness mainly due to transitory/one-off factors
\begin{itemize}
\item several idiosyncratic factors
\item \textbf{half} of deceleration due to quality adjustment of cell phone
prices (Verizon plans unlimited data--quality adjusted this is a
price drop)
\item import inflation was weak in March and April due to dollar
appreciation -- external deflationary pressures
\end{itemize}
\item underlying trend is still healthy. at the heart of our forecast is
the view that \textbf{declining slack and accelarating wage growth} will
support prices, and that inflation will resume its gradual rise
\item in sum, we view the slowdown in core inflation as primarily a
transitory phenomenon
\item our medium-term outlook remains unchanged
\item but there is a fair amount of uncertainty surrounding this
baseline forecast, and we will be watching closely whether
slowdown continues
\end{itemize}
\item financial conditions generally eased of the last six months and remain strongly
supportive of consumer spending and output
\begin{itemize}
\item higher equity prices, driven by perceptions of an improved global
outlook and positive news on corporate earnings
\item lower yields, partly in reaction to inflation data and political headlines
\item lower credit spreads
\item equity market volatility very low, both actual volatility and
option-implied volatility ("fear index" VIX near multidecade lows)
\item rising commodity prices
\item U.S. political uncertainty weighed briefly on market sentiment and
stock prices, but markets soon recovered
\item segue: what matters more than ups and downs in financial markets
is the underlying trajectory. the same holds for other economic indicators
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\newpage
\begin{itemize}
\item the role of trends in forecasting
\begin{itemize}
\item Macroeconomic and financial data noisy
\begin{itemize}
\item Single data releases affect forecast little
\item Ups and downs in financial markets less important than underlying trend
\item how do we separate the signal from the noise?
\item what is the framework in the back of our heads to understand
the underlying trajectory?
\end{itemize}
\item when we forecast economic variables there are \textbf{three questions} we
continually think about: (1) Where are we now? (2) Where are we
going? (3) How are we going to get there?
\begin{itemize}
\item We take \textbf{signal} about these three things
\end{itemize}
\item "Nowcast" - gauge where we are now (word creation, forecast of the
present)
\begin{itemize}
\item examples of things we nowcast
\item various indicators affect our nowcast of Q2 GDP
\end{itemize}
\item Long-run trends -- after transitory factors and "shocks" have died
out -- equilibrium. g*, u*, pi*, i*
\item SEP similar: current year, next few years, and "long-run value"
\item \textbf{gaps}: How large is the gap and how quickly can we close it?
\end{itemize}
\item the trend in interest rates
\begin{itemize}
\item Mary Daly talked about this in April
\begin{itemize}
\item "equilibrium FFR" = 2\% + 1\% = 3\% (median SEP long-run
projection)
\item we can call this "normal interest rate" i*
\item this corresponds to the "normal/long-run fed funds rate"
\item and it also drives all other interest rates, including Treasury
yields, corporate bond yields, mortgage rates
\end{itemize}
\item pi* inflation trend/perceived inflation target
\begin{itemize}
\item this was the main issue of monetary policy in 1970s and 1980s
\end{itemize}
\item r* equilibrium real rate
\begin{itemize}
\item this has shifted into focus since pi* has stabilized
\item remember: r* is the real (inflation-adjusted) interest rate
consistent with the economy growing at potential and inflation at
target. r=r* means monetary policy is neutral, neither
expansionary nor contractionary
\item FOMC "central tendency" is 0.8-1.0\%
\item large degree of uncertainty around estimates of r*, but some
consensus that it has fallen quite a bit over the last 20 years
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Decline in pi* and r*.
\begin{itemize}
\item this pi* estimate is from long-range surveys (SPF)
\item r* estimate is the average from three macroeconomic models,
including Laubach-Williams
\begin{itemize}
\item models agree that r* has fallen and is currently quite close to zero
\item somewhat lower r* than from surveys/SEP, which are closer to 1\%
\end{itemize}
\item sum of the two gives an estimate of the "normal interest rate"
\item don't put too much stock in the \emph{exact level} of the last data
point, due to the uncertainty around estimates of r*
\end{itemize}
\item long-term rate fluctuates around trend
\begin{itemize}
\item slightly above but generally close to this estimate of i*
\begin{itemize}
\item higher because on average long-term rates are above short-term
rates, the yield curve on average slopes upward
\end{itemize}
\item What does this mean in practice?
\begin{itemize}
\item When we ask the question "Where is the ten-year yield going to
be a few years from now?" we would give a very different answer
in 2017 than in, say, the 1990s. There is clearly a "new normal"
\item We can't just assume we are going back to the average post-war
interest rate.
\item Instead, we have to account for these shifting trends.
\item In my research I have found that doing so makes a big difference
for forecasting and understanding the evolution of interest
rates.
\item Forecasters need to take a stance on r* and i* (not just
the FOMC)
\item We need to account for trend components in interest rates,
just like we do in macroeconomic indicators like GDP growth and inflation
\end{itemize}
\item Consequences of low normal interest rate:
\begin{itemize}
\item greater chance of returning to zero lower bound with the need to
use unconventional monetary policy tools
\item could avoid this by raising pi* (higher inflation target) or r*
(improved long-run economic growth)
\item in any event, lower r* and i* poses new challenges for monetary policy
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item conclude
\end{itemize}

\section{other topics}
\label{sec:orgd507b3e}
\begin{itemize}
\item risks to the forecast
\begin{itemize}
\item downside and upside risks are balanced
\item downside risk: low inflation -- the slowdown in core inflation could
be more persistent than we anticipate. or: stronger dollar
appreciation due to normalization of monetary policy
\item upside risk: labor market overheating, increasing wage pressure
\end{itemize}
\item balance sheet
\begin{itemize}
\item auto-pilot, boring, "gradual and predictable reduction"
\item want to avoid situation where balance sheet is automatically reduced
more quickly when economy slows down (rates fall, refis and MBS
prepayments speed up)
\item hence the proposal is to use "roll-off caps" which limit the amounts
that are allowed to mature, amounts above the limits are reinvested
\item roll-off caps gradually increased
\end{itemize}
\item fiscal policy
\begin{itemize}
\item our forecast continues to incorporate a modest amount of fiscal expansion in
the form of tax cuts
\item However, size, timing and composition of this possible stimulus
remain considerably uncertain.
