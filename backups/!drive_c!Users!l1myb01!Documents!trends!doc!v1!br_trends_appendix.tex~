\section{Additional details for affine term structure model}
\label{app:dtsm}

% real yields, real term premium
Here we provide further details and additional results for the affine
term structure model of Section \ref{sec:model}. First, we
consider prices and yields of
real (i.e., inflation-indexed) bonds. Just like prices of nominal
bonds, prices of real bonds are exponentially affine in the
risk factors, $\log(\hat{P}_t^{(n)}) = \hat{A}_n + \hat{B}_n'
Z_t$.
Hats denote variables pertaining to real bonds. The loadings are
determined by the recursions
\[ \hat{A}_{n+1} = \hat{A}_n + \hat{B}_n' (\mu - \lambda_0) +
\hat{C}_n, \quad \hat{C}_n := \frac{1}{2} \hat{B}_n' \Sigma \Sigma'
\hat{B}_n, \quad \hat{B}_{n+1} = -(0,0,1,1,0)' + (\phi -
\lambda_1)'\hat{B}_n, \] $\hat{C}_n$ captures the convexity in real
bonds, and the initial conditions are $\hat{A}_0=0, \hat{B}_0 =
(0,0,0,0,0)'$. Specifically,
\[ \hat{B}_n^{\pi^\ast} = 0, \quad \hat{B}_n^c = 0, \quad \hat{B}_{n+1}^{r^\ast} =
\hat{B}_n^{r^\ast} - 1, \quad \hat{B}_{n+1}^g = \phi_g \hat{B}_n^g -
1,\]
\[ \hat{B}_{n+1}^x = -\lambda_{r^\ast x} \hat{B}_n^{r^\ast} -
\lambda_{gx} \hat{B}_n^g + \phi_x \hat{B}_n^x. \] Real yields,
$\hat{y}^{(n)}_t = - \log(\hat{P}^{(n)}_t) / n$, are affine in the
risk factors. It is instructive to consider real forward rates for
inflation-indexed borrowing from $n$ to $n+1$, for which we have
\begin{eqnarray*} \hat{f}^{(n)}_t &=& \log(\hat{P}^{(n)}_t) -
\log(\hat{P}^{(n+1)}_t) = \hat{A}_n - \hat{A}_{n+1} + (\hat{B}_n -
\hat{B}_{n+1})' Z_t \\ &=& - \hat{B}_n'(\mu - \lambda_0) - \hat{C}_n +
r^\ast_t + \phi^n_g g_t + (\hat{B}^x_n - \hat{B}^x_{n+1}) x_t\\ &=&
-\hat{C}_n + E_t (r_{t+n}) + \hat{ftp}_t^{(n)}.
\end{eqnarray*} Therefore, changes in $r_t^\ast$ affect all real
forward rates equally and hence act as a level factor. Changes in the
real-rate gap $g_t$ affect short-term real rates more strongly than
long-term rates, and therefore affect the slope. The last row
clarifies that real forward rates can be decomposed into convexity, an
expectations component, $E_t(r_{t+n}) = r^\ast_t + \phi^n_g g_t$, and
a real forward term premium, $\hat{ftp}_t^{(n)} = - \hat{B}^x_n\mu_x +
\hat{B}_n' \lambda_0 + (\hat{B}^x_n - \hat{B}^x_{n+1}) x_t$.

For real yields we have
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{y}_t^{(n)} &=& -\log(\hat{P}_t^{(n)})/n = -\Hat{A}_n/n - \hat{B}_n'Z_t/n \\
 &=&  \underbrace{r_t^\ast + \frac{1-\phi_g^n}{n(1-\phi_g)}
    g_t}_{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} E_t r_{t+i}/n} \quad \underbrace{ -\hat{A}_n/n
    - \hat{B}_n^x x_t/n.}_{\text{convexity and real yield term premium}}
\end{eqnarray*}
which shows that the equilibrium real rate $r^\ast_t$ acts as a level factor for
the real yield curve, and that the impact of the real-rate gap $g_t$
diminishes with the yield maturity. 

To understand the real term premium it is helpful to first consider the
term premium in the one-period-ahead real forward rate, which is
\[ \hat{ftp}^{(1)}_t = Cov_t(m_{t+1}^r, r_{t+1}) = -[\lambda_{0
r^\ast} + \lambda_{0 g} + (\lambda_{r^\ast x} + \lambda_{g x})x_t]. \]
If the real SDF positively correlates with the real rate, then real
bonds are risky in the sense that their payoffs are low in times of
high marginal utility. In this case, the real term premium is positive
to compensate investors for this risk.\footnote{Variation in the real
term premium is driven by changes in the risk-premium factor $x_t$,
which affects prices of risk; quantities of risk are constant due to
homoskedasticity of the state variables.}

Nominal forward rates from $n$ to $n+1$ are:
\begin{eqnarray*} f^{(n)}_t &=& \log(P^{(n)}_t) - \log(P^{(n+1)}_t) =
A_n - A_{n+1} + (B_n - B_{n+1})' Z_t \\
&=& \underbrace{- c_n}_{\text{convexity}} +
    \underbrace{\pi^\ast_t + \phi_c^n c_t}_{E_t(\pi_{t+n+1})} + \underbrace{r^\ast_t +
    \phi^n_g g_t}_{E_t(r_{t+n})} \quad \underbrace{- B^x_n\mu_x +
B_n' \lambda_0 + (B^x_n - B^x_{n+1}) x_t}_{\text{forward term premium}}
\end{eqnarray*} Naturally, nominal forward rates reflect
expectations of  future inflation and  real rates. Changes
in the trend components $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$ parallel-shift the entire path of
these expectations, and therefore affect forward rates at all
maturities equally. Distant forward rates are, on the other hand, only
minimally affected by changes in $c_t$ and $g_t$. The loading of
forward rates on $x_t$ can be shown to approach
$-(\lambda_{\pi^\ast x} + \lambda_{r^\ast x})/(1-\phi_x)$ for large
$n$, meaning that $x_t$ affects distant forward rates due to its
effect on the prices of risk of $\pi^\ast_t$ and $r^\ast_t$. 

In our empirical analysis we will consider the five-to-ten-year
forward rate, i.e., 
\[ f^{(n_1, n_2)}_t = (n_2-n_1)^{-1} \sum_{n = n_1}^{n_2 - 1} f_t^{(n)},
\quad n_1 = 20, \quad n_2 = 40.
\]
Our model implies that this interest rate is even less affected by the
cyclical components $c_t$ and $g_t$ and should exhibit a particularly
close relationship with the trend components $\pi^\ast_t$ and
$r^\ast_t$. 

Although our empirical analysis does not focus on term premia, it is
worth noting the intuition for term premia, which is particularly
simple within our model. The term premium in nominal forward rates, $ftp^{(n)}_t = - B^x_n\mu_x +
B_n' \lambda_0  + (B^x_n - B^x_{n+1}) x_t$, is
composed of the real forward term premium, $\hat{ftp}_t^{(n)}$, and a
forward inflation risk premium, $firp_t^{(n)}$. The intuition is again
easiest for $n=1$:
\[firp_t^{(1)} = Cov_t(m_{t+1}^r, E_{t+1} (\pi_{t+2})) =
-[\lambda_{0\pi^\ast}+\lambda_{0 c} + (\lambda_{\pi^\ast x} +
\lambda_{cx}) x_t]. \] If shocks to inflation
expectations are positively correlated
with the real SDF, then nominal bonds are more risky than real bonds
and require a higher risk premium, i.e., a positive inflation risk
premium. Like the real term premium, the inflation risk premium in
this model is driven only by changes in $x_t$.

% \section{The inflation trend estimate used by Cieslak-Povala}

% \cite{cieslak-povala} used as an estimate of $\pi_t^\ast$ an
% exponentially-weighted moving average of past inflation, calculated
% using the recursion
% $\pi^\ast_t = \alpha \pi^\ast_{t-1} + (1-\alpha) \pi_t$ with
% $\alpha = 0.987$ and $\pi_t$ the year-over-year inflation rate in Core
% CPI.\footnote{We start the recursion with $\pi^\ast_t = \pi_t$ for
%   $t =$ November 1961, ten years before the start of our sample.} This
% estimate has behaved quite differently, decreasing slowly and
% continuously from the early 1980s until the end of our sample
% period. This continuous downward trend is due to the high smoothing
% parameter $\alpha$, which causes the trend estimate to react very
% slowly to changes in inflation.
