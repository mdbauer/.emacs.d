\section{Summary}
\label{sec:org07d44b2}

This paper investigates the effects of monetary policy on
macroeconomic variables in the Euro area, using a novel measure of the stance of
monetary policy in a time-varying parameter VAR. The "Effective
Monetary Stimulus" (EMS) is the difference between a long-term
government bond yield and the neutral nominal interest rate that is
estimated using surveys. The paper argues that the EMS measure
is superior to the short-term interest rate, first because it
incorporates expectations of future policy, and second because it
captures the policy stance even if short-term rates are at the
effective lower bound (ELB) for nominal interest rates. The empirical
results show that monetary policy in the euro area was stimulative
since 2007.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:org1427056}

The paper fills an important gap in the literature on unconventional
monetary policy (UMP), namely to estimate the effects of UMP on
macroeconomic variables. The use of the EMS metric is useful because
there is no obvious way to capture the stance of policy when the
short-term rate is constrained and monetary policy works mainly
through forward guidance and balance sheet measures/asset
purchases. Both the methodology and the results are novel and
relevant. However, currently the paper is still in somewhat rough shape, and the
authors need to make a few changes to make
the paper really convincing.

First, the authors should strive to clearly emphasize the novel,
substantive results of the paper. Surely the empirical bottom line is
not that "we obtain similar results" as a number of other studies, as it
seems from reading Section 2. The empirical contribution also needs to
go very clearly beyond the finding that the EMS is a more reasonable
measure of monetary policy than the short rate, a conclusion that is
repeated ad nauseam although it is quite obvious and already the focus
of Krippner (2014). The paper should answer the question \emph{how}
stimulative policy was during the ELB period in the euro area, and by how
much it stimulated economic variables in comparison to a
counterfactural of neutral monetary policy. Ideally the authors would expand
the analysis so that they can make some quantitative statements about
the effectiveness of QE and forward guidance, even if they cannot
decompose the precise effects of these measures. How would the economy
have evolved without UMP measures? Providing some headline numbers on
the effects of the ECB's policies would be very valuable. The methodological
contribution---using the EMS in a TVP-VAR---is nice, but the empirical
contribution is really what the paper needs to drive home.

Second, the authors need to differentiate their work from studies that
have used long-term interest rates in structural VARs before. A prominent
example is Evans and Marshall (1998), who incorporate term structure
variables in a VAR. Other work has used interest rates with longer
maturity than the short rate as an indicator of monetary policy, such
as, among others, Gertler and Karadi (2015). Using a long rate instead
of short rate is really the crux of the approach of the present paper,
and there are some important open questions: Is this really as
innocuous as the authors make it out to be, i.e., aren't there
additional endogeneity concerns? After all the short rate is
exclusively controlled by the central bank, whereas long rate respond
to all kinds of other factors, many of which are not within the
control of monetary policy. This issue should be frankly
discussed. Furthermore, others have argued that a one-year or two-year
yield is the right interest rate to include (e.g., Gertler-Karadi), so
it's not at all obvious that a 10- or 30-year rate is correct. These
questions are touched on in the paper but need to be addressed front
and center. Finally, the authors may or may not be able to argue that
using the EMS is different than just using a long-term interest rate,
but I suspect that redoing the analysis with just the long-term yield
would give essentially identical results.

Third, the paper lacks focus. The writing is repetitive and somewhat
circular. There is an outline of each section at the beginning of each
section, which can be deleted to save space. There are too many
cross-references to other sections and to appendices. We don't get any
results until almost page 30. The authors need to make a strong effort
to write in a linear, concise manner. Everything that is not central
to the contributions of the paper should be deleted. Section 4.3 should
be combined with the literature review or introduction. Section 4.2
should be substantially shortened, as details are given in appendices
or Krippner (2014). For the main results, it does not seem useful to
provide estimate for two different sample periods, in particular since
we are interested in the ELB period, so that the pre-ELB sample
estimates are not that interesting. Section 8 seems largely
unnecessary. The decomposition into expectations and term premium
components of the EMS is half-baked and the results are puzzling, so
this can be deleted too. On all of these points the authors may have
different opinions and put different emphasis, but the bar for
including analysis (even in an appendix) needs to be higher, and the
exposition needs to be tightened up significantly.

Finally, the natural real rate of interest, r*, is an important
concept for the EMS and the paper as a whole, and it deserves more
emphasis and clarification. The authors mention that there are
different concepts of r* but do not explain which is the right concept
for calculating the EMS. Given the high relevance of r* in discussions
about monetary policy these days, I recommend the authors emphasize
the important role it plays in their analysis. They may also consider
using the Laubach-Williams estimate of r* for the euro area (Holston,
Laubach, Williams, JIE, 2017) plus long-run expectations of inflation
from surveys, as their neutral interest rate. An open question is
whether the LNIR even matters for the EMS. The authors seem to suggest
it doesn't, but this seems worthwhile to look into and mention.

\section{Further suggestions}
\label{sec:orgad2560b}

The following are suggestions that I think would improve the paper but
are not required.

\begin{itemize}
\item To provide a conceptual framework, it may be useful to show how
aggregate demand is determined in a simple New Keynesian framework,
which quite clearly shows that the entire path of future short rates
matters. This could give a theoretical justification for the EMS. Of
course this would raise the issue that in the standard (linearized)
model only expectations matter, but the authors could point to
models in which (exogenous shocks to) term premia matter in the IS curve as well.

\item Why do the authors not estimate the model for the United States? The
situation and questions are quite similar, the data availability may
be better, and the model seems easily applicable to answer pressing
questions about the effectivenes of the Fed' UMPs.

\item In addition, or even instead of, the conditional impulse response
functions, it would be useful to include unconditional/average
IRFs, to understand the overall effect of monetary policy on macro
variables.

\item Have the authors estimated a standard constant-parameter SVAR? While
good arguments can be made for a TVP-VAR, it begs the question
whether a conventional SVAR would give such different results. It
may be useful to include such results as a baseline.
\end{itemize}
