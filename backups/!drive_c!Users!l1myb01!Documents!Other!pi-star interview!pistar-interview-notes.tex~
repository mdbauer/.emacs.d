TODO: get some more pithy statements and example from \textbf{Naked Money}

\section{Inflation}
\label{sec:org0c40f8f}
\begin{itemize}
\item First let¡¦s back up a little and start by asking, why is inflation
important? How is it measured? And why is high inflation a bad thing
for the economy?
\begin{itemize}
\item At a basic level, inflation is simply the rate at which prices
increase in the U.S., on average
\item There are actually people employed by a government agency that go
to stores and just look at prices and write them down. And that's
hundreds of people and thousands of prices, recorded all the time
in all parts of our economy.
\item Since inflation measures how fast prices rise, the flip side of
this definition is that it also measures the rate at which our money
loses value.
\item So you see that is pretty important to know. On a general level,
money and prices are central to our economic system, and
this makes inflation so important. And more specifically, it
matters for all kinds of decisions: how much of a wage increase
people should try to negotiate, how much to save for retirement,
just to name a couple.
\item High inflation is bad on so many different levels. If prices rise
quickly, I cannot keep much cash in my bank account since it loses
value so quickly. And if wages don't keep up with inflation, we
won't be able to afford as much as we used to. It's also bad for
people who have invested or lent out their money, for example
their retirement savings will be worth less.
\item Now if we all knew for sure that inflation was going to be, say,
10\% exactly for the rest of our lives, then we could plan
accordingly, demand higher wages and interest rates, and so
forth. But unfortunatley high inflation always goes hand in hand
with a lot of ups and downs, and a lot of uncertainty.
\item So what we really want is low and stable inflation.
\end{itemize}

\item In recent years, inflation has been relatively low, but I remember
back in the late 70s early 80s when inflation was double digit. What
was going on then?
\begin{itemize}
\item This period is crucial to understand both inflation and the role
of the central bank. It even has its own name, the "Great
Inflation", capitalized.
\item This period shows what happens if the central bank screws
up. Economists nowadays agree that inflation got out of control
because of a failure of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve.
\item Let's take a step back and think about monetary policy 101: As we
are all well aware, the Fed can slow down the economy by raising
interest rates, and support the economy by lowering interest
rates. Another way to say this is the Fed can let the supply of
money increase quickly or slow down the growth of the money
supply. In the former case, prices tend to rise more quickly, and
in the latter case, they tend to rise more slowly. So in the long
run, aside from the ups and downs, aside from temporary cycles and
shocks, in the long run it's the central bank that controls
inflation. That's what prompted Milton Friedman's famous
statement: Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary
phenomenon.
\item So what happened in the 1970s is that the Fed allowed the money
supply to growth too quickly, it didn't raise interest rates
enough in response to the circumstances at the time, in particular
the oil shocks of the 70s. It lost control of inflation, and in 1980 we ended
up with 15\% of inflation. To reverse this situation was a long and
painful process, involving two recessions in the early 1980s, but
thanks to a new Fed Chairman at the time, Paul Volcker, the Fed
finally got the situation under control and we've had low and
stable inflation ever since.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Pi-star, 2\% Inflation Target}
\label{sec:org5a36e05}
\begin{itemize}
\item Now let¡¦s talk about the inflation target. What is an inflation
target, and why do you guys call it ¡§pi-star¡¨?
\begin{itemize}
\item So we know the central bank ultimately can determine the inflation
rate. And the goal is to have low and stable inflation.
\item One particularly effective method to accomplish this goal is for
the central bank to publicly announce that it is committed to a
certain low rate of inflation, such as two percent.
\item Making such a public commitment to a goal of a certain inflation
rate, that is called an inflation target
\item It's important to understand that it is a goal for the \textbf{long
run}. We may have a recession, and inflation may drop below the
target. Or we may have an oil price boom that pushes energy
inflation and with it overall inflation above the target
rate. That is okay. It's not possible to be at the inflation
target all the time. We just want to be close to the inflation target on
average, over the long run.
\item (symmetric vs. ceiling)
\item Now why "pi*"? It's for two reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item First, economists typically denote the rate of inflation by the
Greek letter "pi".
\item Second, the long-run values of economic variables, the
equilibrium that the economy goes back to once all the
transitory shocks and ups and downs have dissipated, such
long-run values are denoted with asterisks. Hence: pi*
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Tell us a little about the history pi*. Has the Federal Reserve
always had an inflation target?
\begin{itemize}
\item For the longest time, the Fed did not appear to have a specific
inflation target in mind when setting monetary policy.
\item Certainly the Fed didn't publicly announce a target until recently.
\item However, since about the 1990s, inflation has always remained low and
stable, and at some point people realized that the Fed appeared to
be targeting a certain inflation rate. So you could maybe say
they had an implicit inflatino target, but it wasn't public.
\end{itemize}
\item When did the Fed announce an explicit inflation target, and what
exactly did we announce?
\begin{itemize}
\item In January 2012, the Fed finally came out publicly with an
inflation target.
\item As part of a statement on longer-run goals, the FOMC said that a
rate of 2 percent was most consistent with its mandate.
\item They were pretty explicit and clarified
what price index they would focus on, namely the price index for
personal consumption expenditures, or PCE.
\item So in short, they said that their long-run goal for PCE inflation
was going to be 2\%
\end{itemize}
\item Is there something magical about 2\%? Why don¡¦t we want zero percent
inflation?
\begin{itemize}
\item Exactly, why 2\%? That is the million-dollar question about the
inflation target.
\item It's probably a bad idea to aim for zero percent inflation, for a
couple of reasons.
\item The first is that the statistical agencies tend to overestimate
the true rate of inflation. That means, if we wanted truly stable
prices, we would want about .5-1\% of measured inflation.
\item But a more important argument is the so-called "greasing the
wheels" argument, which was made forcefully by Janet Yellen at
FOMC meetings in the 1990s, when she was a governor
\item The argument goes that you need a little bit of inflation to keep
the economy running smoothly.
\item When businesses run into rough
times, they would like to cut wages to keep costs down. That's
hard to do, so they instead cut hours or fire workers. But
inflation helps to deal with this problem: if businesses simply
don't raise wages, then in inflation-adjusted terms their wage
costs have fallen. That way they might be able to avoid layoffs,
and we would see more people keep their jobs during a recession.
\item And you have a somewhat similar situation for monetary policy. The
Fed cannot lower interest rates below zero (just like businesses
cannot easily cut wages). But with positive inflation and zero
interest rates, inflation-adjusted interest rates are negative, so
businesses and consumers have an incentive to invest it and spend
their money.
\item So in short, some inflation is useful to "grease the wheels" of
the economy, and for it to better whether downturns.
\end{itemize}
\item We¡¦ve been talking about the U.S. and the Fed, but what about other
countries and other central banks? Is the 2\% inflation target pretty
consistent across countries?
\begin{itemize}
\item Yes, a number of central bank have a 2\% inflation target
\item The first were the kiwis. The New Zealand central bank announced
a 2\% target in the late 1980s
\item Many central banks have followed suit.
\item A prominent example is the ECB, which aims for inflation below but
close to 2\%.
\item Note here that there is a subtle but important difference with our
inflation target. Our target is \textbf{symmetric}, so the Fed would try to avoid
being either below or above 2\%. On the other hand the ECB views 2\%
as a ceiling, so they are more comfortable with inflation being
below 2\% than it being above 2\%.
\end{itemize}
\item We hear a lot about the importance of ¡¥expectations¡¦. Why is it so
important that people view the central bank¡¦s inflation target to be
credible, and expect future inflation to average about 2\%? That is,
why are expectations important, and why is credibility important?
\begin{itemize}
\item Economics is one of the few areas in life where just expecting
something can actually make it come true.
\item Kidding aside, it's very clear that expectations about the future
play a fundamental role in our decision-making.
\item If I expect inflation of 10\% then I'm going to try to negotiate a
higher wage increase than if I expected 0\% inflation.
\item Inflation expectations also matter for businesses setting prices,
for savers that invest their money, and for the central bank
trying to stimulate or slow down the economy.
\item As a result of all of this, actual future inflation is to a large
extent determined by expectations of future inflation.
\item So if people confidently expect 2\% inflation, then this goes a
long way towards inflation actually being close to 2\%.
\item That is the main reason why it is so effective for a central bank
to publicly announce an inflation target.
\item Of course, this only works if people actually believe this
announcement, that is, if the inflation target is credible. Only
in that case will businesses and workers make their decisions
based on the expectation of a future rate of inflation that is
driven by the announced inflation target.
\end{itemize}
\item There has been discussion about possibly raising the inflation
target, for example to 3 or 4\%. Do you think that is a good idea?
What are the arguments for and against such a move?
\begin{itemize}
\item This is indeed one of the most heated discussions curently going
on among economists and central bankers.
\item Chair Yellen at her recent press conference said that whether to
raise inflation targets is one of the most critical questions
that central bankers face these days.
\item The argument for raising the target, which John Williams has
described very clearly in recent speeches and Economic Letters,
goes as follows: pi* is one determinant, together with r* (about
which I understand we have another segment in this series), that
determines the overall level of interest rates. higher pi*
therefore means a higher "normal" level of interest rates. If a
recession hits, the central bank cuts interest rates, but it can
only cut to zero. So if you start out with a higher level of
interest rates, then there is more room to cut rates, that is,
more room to support the economy which faces a downturn
\item Recently a group of 22 economists, including prominent figures
such as the former Minneapolis Fed president and the chief
economist of Barack Obama, wrote a public letter to Chair Yellen
asking her to consider raising its 2 percent inflation target
\item But it's a really difficult question, and there are arguments both
for and against raising the target.
\item An obvious reason against raising the target is that it increases
the uncertainty about whether the Fed is then really committed to
the new target, or whether they might change it again in the
future. And uncertainty of course is a bad thing, as it undermined
the credibility of the target
\item So more research and discussion is needed on this question, but
it's a debate that is actively taking place
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Wrap¡VUp}
\label{sec:org0c62b69}
\begin{itemize}
\item If you had to sum up our conversation about Pi-star to someone in a
short line for a Pete¡¦s coffee, what would you say?
\begin{itemize}
\item It's good for all of us if inflation is low and stable, and the
best way for the Fed to make sure it stays that way is to have an
explicit inflation target that is clear, credible, and well-understood.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
